In the meantime, investors digested domestic growth data, pointing to a stall in November and confirming that the Canadian economy expanded by 0.1% in October as growth in services-producing industries offset losses for goods-producing industries. Oil companies soared 4% to lead the gains in the session, tracking the second consecutive weekly increase for crude oil benchmarks. Torontoâ€™s heavyweight banking and mining sectors also booked gains. On the other hand, concerns about tighter monetary policy continued to press the technology sector, leading losses for the day with a 3% slide for Shopify. The Toronto Exchange will be closed on Monday and Tuesday for holidays."""
