10-Year Treasury Yield Consolidates Around 3.5%United States Government Bond 10Y
The yield on the US 10-year Treasury note, seen as a proxy for global borrowing costs, consolidated around 3.5%, a level not seen since late September, as the narrative started to change from inflation and tightening to slowing growth and the likelihood of a policy pivot. In a recent speech at the Brookings Institution, Fed Chair Jerome Powell suggested that it may be appropriate to slow the pace of interest rate increases as soft economic data hinted that its aggressive policy is taking effect on the economy. The Fed's preferred inflation measure, the US core personal consumption expenditures price index, eased to 5% in line with expectations, in the latest signal that inflation could be peaking. Now all eyes turn to November non-farm payrolls and unemployment rate data, due on Friday, or more clues on future interest rate hikes.

The latest EIA data showed that crude oil stockpiles dropped by about 12.6 million barrels in the week ended November 25, the most since the week ended June 21, 2019, and well above market expectations of a 2.758-million-barrel decline. Meanwhile, OPEC and its allies, including Russia, are expected to keep their output quotes unchanged at their next meeting on December 4. However, there has yet to be a consensus, with further production cuts still on the table. The US benchmark lost more than 6% in November amid persistent concerns about a potential global recession-driven demand downturn.

Mozambique Holds Key Rate at 17.25%Mozambique Interest Rate
Mozambique’s central bank kept its benchmark MIMO interest rate unchanged at 17.25% during its November 2022 meeting, after lifting it by a massive 200 bps in September, to counteract strong inflationary pressures. Policymakers said the decision was supported by the maintenance of high risks and uncertainties, highlighting the effects of the persistence of political tension in Europe and the consequent slowdown in external demand, despite the prospects for a return to single digits in the medium term. The annual inflation rate in Mozambique eased for the second straight month to 11.83% in October of 2022, from 12.01% in the prior month and a peak of 12.1% in August.

Italian Bond Yields Edge HigherItaly Government Bond 10Y
The yield on the Italian 10-year BTP was above 3.8%, rebounding from the three-month low of 3.67% touched on November 24th as investors digested European CPI data and assessed its effect on further tightening from the ECB and the possible start of quantitative tightening. Domestic inflation remained at a 37-year high of 11.8% in November, while Eurozone figures slowed more than expected to 10% from last month’s all-time high of 10.6%. Despite hopes that inflation in the currency bloc may have peaked, ECB Board members have stated that the central bank will continue to raise interest rates in December. Besides higher borrowing costs, Italian bonds were also pressured by expectations that the ECB will announce plans to unload debt from their balance sheets in their next meeting. The spread between the 10-year BTP and the Bund widened to 190bps from the 6-month low of 175bps, pointing to higher perceived credit risk for Italian debt.

US 10-Year Bond Yield Rises After GDP RevisionUnited States Government Bond 10Y
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was at the 3.75% mark, consolidating above the 6-week low of 3.7% touched on November 16th as investors continued to assess the health of the US economy for hints on how much tightening leeway the Federal Reserve has to curb inflation. Second estimates showed that the US GDP grew by 2.9% in the third quarter, above the previous estimate of 2.6% and adding some resilience to the economy ahead of more rate hikes by the Fed. Previously, FOMC member Bullard noted that financial markets are underestimating the chances of higher interest rates next year as inflation remains far too high, also pressuring US debt. The hawkish tone went against minutes from the Fed’s last meeting, which signaled that policymakers agreed that there were concerns about the economy’s health and that it would be appropriate to slow the pace of rate hikes.

US GDP Growth Revised Higher to 2.9%United States GDP Growth Rate
The US economy grew an annualized 2.9% on quarter in Q3 2022, better than an initial estimate of 2.6%, and beating forecasts of 2.7% reflecting upward revisions to consumer and business spending and net trade.

At the same time, consumer spending rose more than anticipated (1.7% vs 1.4%), as growth in health care and "other" services partially offset a decrease in spending on goods, namely motor vehicles and food and beverages. Also, nonresidential investment jumped at a faster 5.1% (vs 3.7%), boosted by equipment and intellectual property. On the other hand, residential investment sank more (-26.8% vs -26.4%) and the drag from private inventories was also revised higher (-0.97 pp vs -0.7 pp).

Indian 10-Year Bond Yield Rebounds from 2-Month LowIndia Government Bond 10Y
The yield on the Indian 10-year government bond was at 7.3%, rebounding from the two-month low of 7.25% touched on November 24th as investors continued to assess the outlook for monetary tightening in the RBI’s next meeting. The Indian economy expanded by 6.3% year-on-year in the third quarter, slightly above market forecasts of 6.2% and raising expectations that the RBI could hike its repo rate by more than 25bps in its next meeting. The central bank has already increased its key rate by 190bps in this tightening cycle, aimed at curbing inflation that has missed the RBI’s upper target for 10 consecutive months. Still, the rebound in yields was capped by reports that spending by the central government should be less than the amount budgeted this financial year for the first time since 2019/20, underscoring the government’s aim to rein in fiscal deficit and reducing credit risk for Indian debt.

Indian Rupee Appreciates Following GDPIndia Currency
The Indian rupee strengthened to 81.3 per USD in the end of November, the highest in two weeks, as stronger-than-expected growth data gave further leeway for the RBI to continue its rate-hiking cycle with a more aggressive rate hike. The Indian economy expanded by 6.3% in the third quarter, slightly higher than market expectations of 6.2% and extending the country’s growth momentum to eight straight quarters. Markets expect the Reserve Bank of India to raise its key rate by at least 25bps in its decision next week, adding to the 180bps in hikes since the start of the cycle in May. The RBI’s latest bulletin stated that there are signs that inflation is slowing, but global headwinds and uncertainty regarding oil prices could leave price growth stubbornly high. Still, relatively slow tightening by the central bank when compared to its American counterpart and trade imbalances drove the rupee to depreciate 8.5% year-to-date.

Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of Australia is widely expected to raise its policy rate by another 25 basis points to 3.1% next week, though analysts lowered the implied peak for rates to around 3.6% from as much as 4.31% back in September amid soft inflation data. The monthly CPI indicator in Australia slowed to 6.9% in the ten months to October from 7.3% in September and defied expectations for a slight acceleration to 7.4%. Last month, the RBA delivered a smaller-than-expected 25 basis point rate increase, and has now lifted the cash rate by a total of 275 basis points since May.

Gold Set to End Week Sharply HigherCommodity
Gold held its recent advance to around $1,800 per ounce on Friday and is set to end the week sharply higher, benefiting mainly from a weak dollar on expectations that the US Federal Reserve would slow the pace of interest rate hikes. Investors also braced for a key US jobs report which could influence the rates outlook, while digesting data which showed that US PCE inflation slowed to a ten-month low in October. On Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that “slowing down at this point is a good way to balance risks,” and that the Fed could moderate the size of rate hikes as soon as December. It confirmed market expectations that the Fed would deliver a smaller 50 basis point rate hike this month, after raising rates by 75 basis point in the last four meetings. Market pricing also indicated that the Fed funds rate will peak below 5% in May 2023 following Powell’s comments, lower than previous expectations for a peak above 5% in June.

Sensex Trades Lower, But Heads for Weekly GainIndia Stock Market
The BSE Sensex retreated 385 points or 0.6% to 62.884.7 in morning trade on Friday, down for the first session in nine, amid weak global cues as investors cautiously awaited the US's November jobs report following reports that factory activity contracted for the first time in over two years last month. Domestically, the Reserve Bank of India is set to revise downward the country's GDP growth for FY 2023 to between 6.5 to 7%, from currently at 7%, amid softening exports and an expected global slowdown next year. The auto index led the losses, dragged down by Ashok Leyland and Bajaj Auto. Other sectors that moved lower were pharmaceuticals, IT, and financials. For the week, however, the index is heading for a 1.0% rise, amid signs that the tightening cycle in the US may slow as soon as December and hopes that the RBI may raise interest rates by smaller percentage points in December as food prices eased.

Market pricing indicated that the Fed funds rate will peak below 5% in May 2023 following Powell’s comments, lower than previous expectations for a peak above 5% in June. Still, Powell warned that controlling inflation “will require holding policy at a restrictive level for some time.”

Retail sales in Australia declined by 0.2% mom to AUD 35.02 billion in October 2022, unrevised from the flash data, reversing from a 0.6% gain in September.

The S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 0.72% to close at 7,302 on Friday, easing from seven-month highs, with banking and energy stocks leading the retreat.

South Korea Inflation Slows to 7-Month LowSouth Korea Inflation Rate
Consumer prices in South Korea increased 5% year-on-year in November 2022, rising at the slowest pace since April and coming in slightly below expectations of 5.1% as global energy prices trended lower and the economy slowed. November’s figure also followed a 5.7% gain in October and posted more than 1% below a 24-year high of 6.3% hit in July, in a sign that the Bank of Korea may consider slowing or pausing its tightening campaign. The BOK opted for a smaller 25 basis point rate hike to 3.25% in November after delivering a half-percentage point increase in October, as policymakers try to balance the fight against inflation with economic risks. The central bank has now lifted interest rates by a total of 275 basis points since August last year, and Governor Rhee Chang-Yong said they would continue to hike rates as needed “for some time” which he later clarified as a period of three months.

The ISM Manufacturing PMI declined to 49 in November of 2022 from 50.2 in October and more than market forecasts of 49.8 pointing to the first contraction in factory activity since May 2020.

The S&P Global US Manufacturing PMI was revised slightly higher to 47.7 in November of 2022 from a preliminary of 47.6, but continued to point to the first contraction in factory activity since June of 2020.

Employment growth slowed as pressure on capacity dwindled and backlogs of work contracted strongly. On a more positive note, supply chains improved for the first time since October 2019, with price pressures softening as a result of reduced demand for inputs from firms. Input costs rose at the slowest rate for two years. Meanwhile, business confidence remained historically subdued, as concerns regarding inflation and customer hesitancy weighed on optimism.

Euro Tops $1.05Euro Area Currency
The euro topped $1.05 to start the December month, a level not seen since late June, and extending a 5.5% gain in November, which was its best month since September 2010. The common currency has benefited from a fall in the USD as investors bet the Fed will slow the pace of tightening from its December meeting, while also lowering expectations for the fed funds rate peak. In Europe, it is still unclear what the ECB will do in the next meeting. The latest inflation report for the Eurozone showed that annual inflation slowed to 10% in November, while the core CPI stood unchanged at 5%. Despite some early evidence that inflation is slowing among developed economies, it remains still uncomfortable high for policymakers. The ECB remains committed to raising interest rates to tame price growth, while analysts stay divided on whether the central bank will hike borrowing costs by a 75bps for the third time when it meets in December or will opt for a smaller 50bps increase.

Such data came on top of a somewhat dovish speech from Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday, which prompted markets to price in an over 80% chance of a smaller 50 bps hike in December.

South African Rand Plunges on Farmgate ScandalSouth Africa Currency
The South African rand depreciated sharply to 18 against the USD, the lowest since November 3rd, on rumors that President Ramaphosa was considering resigning after a panel report found preliminary evidence he may have committed serious misconduct. In what has become known as the “Farmgate” scandal, Ramaphosa is alleged to have covered up a $4 million theft from his Phala Phala farm in the northeast of the country in 2020, while some $580,000 of this was found beneath sofa cushions. Further losses were capped by a weaker dollar on hopes of smaller US rate hikes. Locally, the South African Reserve Bank raised the key repo rate by an expected 75 bps at its November meeting, driven by the Bank’s assessment that risks to the inflationary outlook remain skewed to the upside while the risks to the medium-term domestic growth outlook are assessed to the downside.

South African Stocks Rise for 2nd DaySouth Africa Stock Market
The JSE FTSE All Share index was up about 0.3% to close at 75,020 on Thursday, the second straight session of gains, as solid gains in luxury retailer Richemont and resource-linked stocks were outweighed by weakness in financials. In the meantime, Sasol shares fell nearly 5% after the company said it expects challenges at its Secunda operations to impact coal and fuel production, although higher crude oil prices are seen boosting half-year profit by more than 20%. Market sentiment was supported by hopes of smaller US rate hikes and optimism around China's Covid policy. Meanwhile, investors were digesting the news that South African President Cyril Ramaphosa was considering resigning over an advisory panel’s report that found he may have violated the constitution. On the data front, the seasonally adjusted Absa Purchasing Managers’ Index hit a six-month high of 52.6 points in November, pointing to a modest expansion in the country's factory activity.

South Africa 10-Year Bond Yield Hits 31-Month HighSouth Africa Government Bond Africa
South Africa's 10-year government bond yield climbed to a 31-month high of 11.2%, on mounting pressure on President Ramaphosa to resign after an independent panel report published on Wednesday found preliminary evidence that he may have violated his oath of office and committed serious misconduct. On the monetary policy front, the South African Reserve Bank is poised to continue its tightening cycle. The central bank delivered another big rate hike of 75 basis points at its November 2022 meeting, with the aim of taming high inflation and also aligning with the Fed’s movements so far. Since November last year, the MPC has raised interest rates off record lows by 350 basis points, bringing the key repo rate to 7% and the prime lending rate for consumers to 10.5%. The South African Reserve Bank reiterated that it needs to see consumer inflation steadily decline to the 4.5% mid-point of its targeted range before it will consider pausing or stopping its current rate hiking cycle.

Brazil Factory Activity Shrinks for 1st Time in 9 MonthsBrazil Manufacturing PMI
The S&P Global Brazil Manufacturing PMI was down for the sixth consecutive month to 44.3 in November of 2022 from 50.8 in the previous month. The latest reading pointed to the first contraction in the country's factory sector since February, with both new orders and output plunging at the quickest rate since May of 2020, linked to policy uncertainty. The challenging external conditions also weighed on overall sales, with exports down at the sharpest pace in two-and-a-half years. At the same time, payroll numbers and input purchasing continued to be reduced. On the price front, input prices fell for the second month, especially those for metal, plastic and resin, as suppliers reportedly offered discounts due to improved availability of some items. In turn, firms lowered their own selling prices for the second month running in November. Although companies maintained an upbeat view towards the year-ahead outlook, the overall level of positive sentiment slipped to a 13-month low.

Botswana Holds Key Interest Rate at 2.65%Botswana Interest Rate
The Central Bank of Botswana left its benchmark interest rate steady at 2.65% during its December 2022 meeting. The decision was aimed at continuing to support the ongoing economic recovery against a backdrop of strong inflationary pressures and uncertainty. Botswana's annual inflation fell for a second month to 13.1% in October of 2022 from 13.8% in September but is still far above the central bank's 3%-6% preferred band. The Bank projects that inflation will continue to trend downwards and fall within the objective range in the third quarter of 2024. Regarding growth, the domestic economy should operate below full capacity in the short-to-medium term and, therefore, not creating any demand-induced inflationary pressures. The GDP grew by 5.6% year-on-year in the second quarter of 2022, marking the sixth consecutive quarter of economic expansion. The Bank also announced that will withdraw some of the COVID-19 relief measures introduced in April 2020, with effect from January 1, 2023.

At the same time, hopes of reopening in China continued to support market sentiment. Luxury retailer Richemont, tech stocks and resource-linked companies were the top gainers. Domestically, however, an independent panel appointed by the speaker of South Africa's parliament on Wednesday found preliminary evidence that Ramaphosa had violated his oath of office during the investigation of a robbery at his farm, findings that could lead to his eventual impeachment. On the data front, the seasonally adjusted Absa Purchasing Managers’ Index hit a six-month high of 52.6 points in November of 2022, pointing to a modest expansion in the country's factory activity.

Euro Area Manufacturing PMI Points to 5th Month of Falling Factory ActivityEuro Area Manufacturing PMI
The S&P Global Eurozone Manufacturing PMI was revised slightly lower to 47.1 in November of 2022 from a preliminary of 47.3, although it remained above 46.4 in October which was the lowest reading since May of 2020. Figures pointed to a fifth straight month of falling factory activity, with all of the monitored eurozone nations which combined account for roughly 90% of manufacturing activity, showing a contraction. Output continued to decline although at a slower pace and the level of incoming new orders fell sharply once again as client demand in markets across the eurozone and other parts of the globe deteriorated. There was also a further easing of inflationary pressures, in part due to weaker demand and reduced strain on suppliers. Input purchasing was subsequently reduced to the quickest extent since May 2020 and firms remained pessimistic in their outlook for the next 12 months.

US Natural Gas Down 5%Commodity
US natural gas futures extended losses to over 5% to $6.3/MMBtu on Friday, the lowest since November 14th and were set for an over 13% weekly fall, after Freeport delayed the restart of its LNG export plant to the end of the year from mid-December, leaving more gas in the domestic market. Natural gas futures were already lower on forecasts for less cold weather and lower demand which should allow utilities to leave more gas into storage. Also, average gas output in the US Lower 48 states rose to a record 99.5 bcfd in November, up from 99.4 bcfd in October. At the same time, the US government is stepping up efforts to reduce the risk of a railroad worker strike that could disrupt coal deliveries and force power generators to burn more gas.

Loonie Remains Under PressureCanada Currency
The Canadian dollar weakened to 1.35 against the dollar, as investors digested the latest jobs report and await the Bank of Canada monetary policy meeting on Wednesday. Data from Statistics Canada showed the economy added 10.1K jobs in November, compared with market expectations of a 5K gain while the jobless rate unexpectedly fell to 5.1%. Money markets expect the Bank of Canada to raise interest rates by 25 bps next Wednesday, after delivering a 50 bps rate hike in October. The central bank unexpectedly slowed the pace of interest-rate hikes as the economy showed signs of a sharp slowdown. The latest data showed that the Canadian economy grew an annualized 2.9% in the third quarter of 2022, beating expectations for a modest 1.5%, but still the weakest reading since Q2 2021.

Italian Electricity Prices Rise to €400Italy Electricity Price
Electricity prices in Italy approached €400 per megawatt hour in December, rebounding by 250% since hitting the 15-month low of €110 on November 1st amid the upswing in European natural gas prices ahead of the winter. Expectations of a colder front and dependency on alternative sources due to the supply halt from Russia drove up natural gas prices for delivery in Italy, ramping up the cost of electricity distributors. Until the first half of 2022, natural gas was responsible for 56% of Italy’s electricity production. Still, demand for energy in households remained robust as Italy’s new right-wing government pledged €30 billion to support households with soaring energy costs, adding to the €75 billion in energy aid from the prior government and reducing people’s propensity to cut back on consumption. Previous shortage concerns due to the natural gas supply halt from Russia lifted Italian electricity prices to a record-high of €650 at the end of August.

Wall Street Under Pressure After NFP ReportUnited States Stock Market
US stocks traded in the red on Friday, with the Dow Jones falling 100 points, the S&P 500 down 0.6% and the Nasdaq 0.9% after stronger-than-expected jobs data cooled expectations that the Federal Reserve will soon slow its tightening campaign. The Labor Department's closely watched employment report showed that the economy added 263,000 jobs last month while average hourly earnings unexpectedly increased. This robust report was a blow for those expecting a policy pivot, given that Fed chair Jerome Powell signaled earlier this week that the central bank would keep its aggressive stance if there were no signs of a cooling job market. On the corporate side, Marvell Technology tumbled 5% after the semiconductor company missed quarterly revenue and earnings estimates. Conversely, UiPath skyrocketed more than 10% after posting results that surprised investors on the upside. For the week, the Dow was little changed, while both the S&P and the Nasdaq were heading for the second week of gains.

US Natural Gas Falls to Over 2-Week LowCommodity
US natural gas futures fell 3% to $6.5/MMBtu on Friday, the lowest since November 15th and were set for an over 11% weekly fall, as forecasts for less cold weather and lower demand lower should allow utilities to leave more gas into storage. The latest EIA report showed US utilities added 81 bcf last week, slightly less than the 84-bcf draw expected by markets. Also, average gas output in the US Lower 48 states rose to a record 99.5 bcfd in November, up from 99.4 bcfd in October. Elsewhere, investors continue to monitor the situation at the Freeport LNG plant. The plant's restart has been delayed from November to mid-December. Still, a request to restart the plant needs to be submitted, raising questions about another delay, which would mean more gas in the domestic market. At the same time, the US government is stepping up efforts to reduce the risk of a railroad worker strike that could disrupt coal deliveries and force power generators to burn more gas.

Wheat Falls to Over 1-Year LowCommodity
Chicago wheat futures fell further to $7.4 in early December, the lowest since October 2021, amid strong supply from the world’s major producers and signs of lower demand. Top exporter Russia achieved a record-high harvest in the current marketing year, extending competition into the US as poor export data divulged by the USDA without any production problems drove bids to decline in price. In the meantime, shipments from Ukraine through Black Sea ports continued after Russia agreed to extend the UN-brokered deal that guarantees a trade corridor for vessels carrying Ukrainian grain in the Black Sea for another four months. According to Ukrainian authorities, the country was able to export more than 11 million tonnes of grain by ships since the start of the deal on August 1st, significantly easing shortage concerns in the next marketing year.

Russian Stocks Close Week Lower, Oil Price Cap AwaitedRussia Stock Market
The ruble-based MOEX Russia index closed 0.3% lower at 2,180 on Friday, dropping 0.7% on the week as EU states continued to disagree on the appropriate price ceiling for services related to the export of Russian oil. Oil-producing giants Lukoil and Rosneft closed in the red as the outlook for the sector continued to worsen. Despite lowering its price ceiling proposal to $60/barrel for the use of European tankers and insurance in deliveries to Asia, Poland did not sign off on the agreement as Urals oil contracts hover well below the proposed cap. Still, tank owners have reportedly already started to charge more for the transportation of Russian crude, pressing demand for the slowing economies of India and China. In the meantime, metallurgists erased their early gains after stronger-than-expected US payroll data lifted the dollar and hampered expectations for industrial demand for top consumer China, driving Rusal and NorNickel to drop 2% and 1%, respectively.

The South African rand was trading around 17.5 per USD, recovering from a near one-month low of 18 hit on December 1st, after the chairman of the ruling ANC party denied speculation that President Cyril Ramaphosa was considering resigning over accusations he may have violated the constitution. An independent panel appointed by South Africa's parliament finds the president has to answer for the theft of at least a half-million dollars from his game farm in 2020 that may not have been declared in his taxes. On the monetary policy front, the South African Reserve Bank lifted the repo rate by another 75 basis points in November, marking the sixth consecutive hike in a year and it is poised to prolong its most aggressive interest-rate hiking cycle until it is confident inflation will return to the 4.5% target midpoint in its forecast horizon. Further gains were capped by a stronger dollar after a robust US jobs report renewed expectations for higher interest rates.

Also, the PMI for electronics increased to 49.2 in November from 49.1 in October. "The weaker global demand and China's Covid-19 containment measures are weighing on domestic demand despite the year-end festive seasons, although there was some respite from lower cost pressures on local manufacturers. Anecdotal evidences suggest that local manufacturers are less optimistic of the economic outlook going forward into the first half of next year", Sophia Poh, vice-president of industry engagement and development at SIPMM said.

The yield on the UK’s 10-year Gilt hovered around 3.1% at the start of December, remaining close to its lowest level since early September, on hopes that the Bank of England might not end up hiking as aggressively as feared and as the UK's budget announced last month helped calm the markets following the turmoil triggered by Liz Truss's mini-budget. Last week, Bank of England Deputy Governor Ramsden said he was backing more interest rate hikes, but would consider cutting rates if the economy developed differently to his expectation. In addition, MPC member Tenreyro said earlier in the month she saw rates on hold next year and then falling in 2024, while Dhingra has warned that an over-tightening of policy could stoke a deep recession. Markets are betting on a 50 to 75 bps increase at the next December meeting.

German 10-Year Bond Yield Rises Back Above 1.8%Germany Government Bond 10Y
Germany's 10-year bund yield rose back above 1.8% at the start of December, rebounding from a near three-month low of 1.76% hit earlier in the session, after better-than-expected US jobs data trimmed bets that the Federal Reserve will soon slow its aggressive interest-rate hikes. In Europe, the European Central Bank will likely continue its policy tightening path despite the ongoing recession risks. President Christine Lagarde warned that some European governments' fiscal policies could lead to excess demand, which in a supply constrained economy, might force monetary policy to tighten more than would otherwise be necessary. Recent data showed the rates of consumer and producer price inflation in the Euro Area slowed sharply, but remained well above the ECB's target. The European Commission expects the Eurozone economy to shrink in Q4 2022 and Q1 2023 amid surging energy prices and rising interest rates.

Still, US bond yields are set to close the week sharply lower after Fed Chairman Powell said that it may be appropriate to slow the pace of interest rate increases as there are recent data points to a slowdown in the US economy.

US Jobless Rate Unchanged at 3.7% in NovemberUnited States Unemployment Rate
The unemployment rate in the US was unchanged at 3.7 percent in November 2022, matching market expectations and remaining close to September's 29-month low of 3.5 percent. The jobless rate has been in a narrow range of 3.5 percent to 3.7 percent since March, suggesting that the tight labor market will likely continue to contribute to inflationary pressure in the world's largest economy for some time to come. The number of unemployed persons rose by 48 thousand to 6.01 million in November, while the number of employed decreased by 138 thousand to 158.5 million.

NFP Top Forecasts at 263KUnited States Non Farm Payrolls
The US economy unexpectedly added 263K jobs in November of 2022, beating market forecasts of 200K, and following an upwardly revised 284K in October. It is the lowest job gain since April last year, as the labour market is normalizing after the pandemic shock. Still, it continues to signal a healthy and tight market, above the pre-pandemic average of 150K-200K jobs created per month. Notable job gains occurred in leisure and hospitality (88K), including a gain of 62K in food services and drinking places; health care (45K); and government (42K), mostly in local government (32K). In contrast, employment declined in retail trade (-30K), namely general merchandise stores (-32K), electronics and appliance stores (-4K), and furniture stores (-3K); and in transportation and warehousing (-15K). Monthly job growth has averaged 392K thus far in 2022, compared with 562K per month in 2021.

US Stock Futures Fall SharplyUnited States Stock Market
Stock futures tied to the blue-chip Dow Jones dropped over 1% on Friday, and those linked to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq lost 1.5% and 2.1%, respectively, as stronger-than-expected jobs data fanned concerns about hawkish central bank policies. The Labor Department's closely watched employment report showed that the US economy added 263,000 jobs last month while average hourly earnings unexpectedly increased. This robust report was a blow for those expecting a policy pivot, given that Fed chair Jerome Powell signaled earlier this week that the central bank would keep its aggressive stance if there were no signs of a cooling job market. On the corporate side, Marvell Technology tumbled more than 6% in premarket trading after the semiconductor company missed quarterly revenue and earnings estimates. Conversely, UiPath skyrocketed 8% after posting results that surprised investors on the upside.

North Macedonia’s gross domestic product advanced by 2% year-on-year in the third quarter of 2022, decelerating from an upwardly revised 4% rise in the previous period. It marks the seventh consecutive quarter of expansion but at the slowest pace since the last quarter of 2021, mainly due to a sharp slowdown in fixed investment (9% vs 41.6% in Q2). At the same time, government spending declined (-4.7% vs -5.2%) and net external demand contributed negatively to growth, as imports (19.4% vs 19.8% in Q2) rose faster than exports (17.8% vs 14.2% in Q2). On the other hand, household consumption picked up (5.4% vs 1.5%).

US Stock Futures Waver Ahead of NFP FiguresUnited States Stock Market
Stock futures contracts tied to the three major indices fluctuated between small gains and losses on Friday, as investors seemed reluctant to make significant moves ahead of the release of the November federal jobs report. The recent rally fueled by hopes that the Federal Reserve will slow the pace of interest rate hikes started to fade amid concerns that such tightening raises the odds of a recession. The non-farm payrolls report will now provide investors with fresh clues about the health of the world's largest economy and the Fed's rate path.

Soybeans futures traded around $14.3 per bushel, below a 10-week high of $14.8 hit on November 30th, as optimism about demand prospects from top importer China were offset by the US government proposal of smaller-than-expected biofuels blending requirements. The US Environmental Protection Agency will call for overall blending mandates of 20.82 billion gallons in 2023, 21.87 billion gallons in 2024 and 22.68 billion gallons in 2025. Elsewhere, news that China was ramping up its vaccination programs to quash Covid numbers renewed expectations of solid demand from the top oilseed consumer.

Ireland GDP Extends Growth MomentumIreland GDP Growth Rate
Ireland’s gross domestic product grew by 2.3 percent on quarter in the three months leading to September of 2022, picking up slightly from the upwardly revised 2.2 percent expansion in the previous quarter. Growth was supported by a 91.8 percent surge in gross domestic fixed capital formation, extending the 20.2 percent increase in Q2, driven mostly through investment in intangible assets. In the meantime, household consumption expanded by 0.3 percent, more than offsetting the 0.3 percent decline in government expenditure. On the other hand, net foreign demand contributed negatively to the economy as imports jumped by 27 percent, largely due to high energy prices, while exports grew by a slower 4.8 percent. On a yearly basis, the Irish GDP expanded by 10.9 percent, easing from the 12.4 percent increase in Q2.

European Shares Flat Ahead of US Jobs ReportGermany Stock Market
European stock markets cut some early losses to trade near the flat line Friday as all eyes turn to US nonfarm payrolls data due later in the day, which will likely provide further clues on the US interest rates outlook. The November report is expected to show 200,000 jobs were added last month, the least in nearly two years, which would indicate that interest rate hikes are having the intended effect on the economy, without signaling a possible recession. Investors have also digested a batch of European economic data. The Euro Area producer price inflation slowed more than expected in October, but remained well above the ECB's target, while Germany's exports fell more than forecast amid soaring inflation, weakening foreign demand and strained supply chains. For the week, European stocks headed for a seventh straight week of gains, the longest such streak since April 2021, amid optimism about China reopening and hopes the Fed would start slowing the pace of its rate hikes this month.

Indian Shares Retreat from RecordIndia Stock Market
The BSE Sensex closed 420 points lower at 62,870 on Friday, halting an eight-session rally and easing from the record-high hit last session as investors took profits ahead of the US jobs report after the closing bell. Indian equities were also pressured by crude oil prices holding their gains for the week, driving import inflation higher and hampering demand for Mumbai’s heavyweight auto manufacturers. Mahindra & Mahindra led the losses in the sector with a 2% drop, and Hero Moto and Maruti Suzuki followed with 1.5% declines. Meantime, the Reserve Bank of India is set to revise downward the country's GDP growth for FY 2023 to between 6.5 to 7%, from currently at 7%, amid softening exports and an expected global slowdown next year. On the policy front, economist polls show that the central bank is expected to raise its key rate by 35bps next week, as the RBI’s bulletin signaled expectations that inflation was slowing. Still, the benchmark index ended the week 1% higher.

The Bank of Mexico hiked its benchmark interest rate by 75 bps to 10% in November, adding to the 600 bps increases seen since its tightening path began in June 2021. Central bank board members stated that inflation risks remain on the upside while forecasting that annual price growth to be at 8.6% by the end of the year. On the dollar side, softer-than-expected inflation reports and a somewhat dovish speech from Fed chair Powell reinforced the case for a modest 50 bps hike in December while spooking investors away from the greenback.

Silver futures rose to above $22.6 per ounce at the start of December, hovering at levels not seen since May amid expectations for a slowdown in monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve. Fed Chairman Powell stated that it is likely that the US central bank will slow the aggressiveness of rate hikes this month, easing demand for the dollar and driving investors toward bullion. Besides bullion, softer rate hikes in the US and a cut in the reserve ratio by the PBoC supported expectations of higher demand for industrial silver usage as electricity conductors, tracking the rebound for copper. Signs of low supply also supported prices, as New York’s COMEX inventories fell 70% in the last 18 months to just over 1 million tonnes. Also, the London Bullion Market Association stockpiles fell for the 10th straight month to a record-low 27.1 thousand tonnes in November.

Still, it continued to indicate inflationary pressures across Europe remained high amid a weakening economic outlook and a deepening energy crisis, suggesting there is a need for continued monetary tightening. Energy cost was up 65.8 percent from a year earlier (vs 108.0 percent in September) and intermediate goods prices increased 17.4 percent (vs 18.9 percent in September). Meanwhile, inflation was little-changed for capital goods (7.5 percent vs 7.6 percent) and for durable consumer goods (at 9.8 percent), while picked up for non-durable consumer goods (16.0 percent vs 15.2 percent).

The EU lowered its proposal to a $60/barrel cap for the use of European tankers and insurance in deliveries to Asia, but Poland continued to argue for a lower ceiling as seaborne Urals oil contracts hover well below the proposed cap. Still, tank owners have reportedly already started to charge more for the transportation of Russian crude, pressing demand for the remaining importers of Russian oil, predominantly India and China. In the meantime, hopes of eased Covid lockdowns in China supported demand for Russian heavyweight miners and metallurgists, with Polyus, Polymetal, and Severstal all trading in the green.

The FAO Food Price Index fell slightly further to 135.7 in November of 2022 from 135.9 in October, sharply below a record high of 159.7 hit in March and above the pre-Ukraine invasions levels as a decline in the cost of cereals, meat and dairy products offset higher prices for vegetable oils and sugar. Cereal prices were down 1.3%, amid a 2.8% decline in wheat prices as Russia rejoined the Black Sea Grain Initiative. Also, prices fell for dairy (-1.2%), namely milk powder; and meat (-0.9%) as increased export supplies of bovine meat from Australia added to already high supplies from Brazil, notwithstanding China’s continuing strong import demand. On the other hand, the cost of vegetable oil was up 2.3%, due to higher international palm and soy oil prices. Finally, sugar surged 5.2%, the first increase in seven months, amid prevailing tight global sugar supplies due to harvest delays in key producing countries and the announcement by India of a lower sugar export quota.

Prices for iron ore cargoes with a 63.5% iron ore content for delivery into Tianjin rose to $105 in December, the highest since mid-September amid easing Covid curbs and measures to stimulate the economy in top consumer China. Key Chinese cities announced looser lockdown rules after protests, raising hopes that other industrial hubs would follow. Also, the country’s largest commercial banks agreed to extend $162 billion in fresh credit lines to private developers to fight the sector’s liquidity crunch, and the PBoC further cut banks' reserve requirement ratio. Earlier, the national bond authority expanded a key financing program by $35 billion to support the sales of bonds after a period of defaults increased the cost of credit for residence builders. Concerns with the debt-ridden property sector remain, as iron ore prices are 34% below their 2022 peak hit in March while property sales continue to plummet. Steady supply from Ukraine also contributed to the fall in prices.

US Economy Likely Added 200K JobsUnited States Non Farm Payrolls
The US economy likely added 200K jobs in November of 2022 which would be the smallest job gain since December of 2020, as the labour market is normalizing after the pandemic shock. Also, many big companies namely in the tech sector have announced layoffs. Still, a job gain of 200K would signal a healthy and tight market, above the pre-pandemic average of 150K-200K jobs created per month. So far this year, job growth averaged 407K per month compared with 562K in 2021. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate is seen steady at 3.7% while pay growth likely slowed. Wages are seen rising 0.3%, below 0.4% in October, pushing the annual rate lower to 4.6% from 4.7%.

Oil Rallies, But Poised for Sharp Monthly LossCommodity
WTI crude futures were trading around $80 per barrel on Wednesday, supported by a bigger-than-expected drop in US crude inventories, while investors kept an eye on the upcoming OPEC+ meeting.

Italian GDP Growth Confirmed at 0.5%Italy GDP Growth Rate
Italy’s gross domestic product expanded by 0.5 percent quarter-on-quarter in the three months leading to September of 2022, in line with preliminary expectations and slowing from the 1.1 percent advance in the second quarter.

Final consumption expenditure grew by 1.8 percent, as a 2.5 percent advance in household consumption offset the 0.2 percent contraction for government expenditure. Also, gross fixed investments expanded by 0.8 percent, supported by investments in machinery (4.1 percent). In the meantime, changes in inventories added 0.2 percentage points to the final GDP growth.

Iron Ore Rises to Over 2-Month HighCommodity
Prices for iron ore cargoes with a 63.5% iron ore content for delivery into Tianjin rose to $103 per tonne in the end of November, the highest since mid-September, and set to close the month 26% higher as expansionary measures from China to sustain a slowing economy outweighed concerns about protests against COVID related restrictions. The country’s largest commercial banks agreed to extend $162 billion in fresh credit lines to private developers to fight the property sector’s liquidity crunch, and the PBoC further cut banks' reserve requirement ratio. Earlier, the national bond authority expanded a key financing program by $35 billion to support the sales of bonds after a period of defaults increased the cost of credit for residence builders. Still, iron ore prices remain 35% below their 2022 peak hit in March as strict pandemic curbs in China hamper demand and risk fresh political unrest.

Steel Falls Sharply After PMI DataCommodity
Steel rebar futures fell to below CNY 3,670 per tonne, the lowest in two weeks, and retreating further from the one-month high of CNY 3,757 from November 17th, as a sharp contraction in Chinese factory activity darkened the outlook for industrial demand. The NBS Manufacturing PMI pointed to the steepest contraction in the sector in seven months in November, as the new wave of Covid cases during the period pressured production and new orders. Pandemic-related protests at the end of the month have set an even gloomier stage for December, risking political turmoil amid the shutdown of multiple industrial hubs. Still, futures remain above the 30-month low of CNY 3,464, supported by measures to stimulate the steel-heavy construction sector. Banks agreed to extend $162 billion in fresh credit lines for private developers, and the PBoC cut the reserve requirement ratio by 25bps to turn up lending to the debt-ridden sector.

China's national health authority said it would bolster vaccination among its senior citizens, a move viewed as essential to ending its strict zero-COVID policy following massive protests across the country. Still, the upbeat tone fueled by speculation that China could ease some coronavirus-related restrictions started to fade amid persistent worries that an aggressive tightening from the Federal Reserve would drag the economy into a recession next year. St. Louis President James Bullard, New York Fed President John Williams, and Fed Vice Cahir Lael Brainard were among the latest policymakers to warn investors that the terminal rate of Fed Funds would be higher than expected.

The yield on the German 10-year Bund was steady at the 1.9% level, hovering close to the two-month low of 1.85% touched on November 24th after the domestic CPI print surprised to the downside and decelerated for the first time since July, raising hopes that inflation in the country could have peaked.

The consumer price inflation in Germany fell to 10.0 percent year-on-year in November 2022, down from October's all-time high of 10.4 percent and below market consensus of 10.4 percent, a preliminary estimate showed.

European Carbon Prices Climb to 4-Week HighCommodity
European carbon prices rose toward €80 a tonne, the highest in four weeks, as prospects of colder temperatures going forward will probably lead to more utilities swapping to carbon-heavy coal, resulting in higher emissions and demand for permits. Meanwhile, EU countries clinch a deal on the legislation called the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR), which sets national targets for emission reductions from road transport, domestic maritime transport, heating of buildings, agriculture, small industrial installations and waste management. The law is part of the overall EU plan to cut net emissions by 55% by 2030 from 1990 levels and to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. Carbon prices remain below record levels of nearly €100 reached in August, as lower natural gas prices reduced the gas-to-coal switch and weaker industrial output across the region also curbed industrial firms' demand for permits.

Meanwhile, the PBoC lowered the reserve requirement ratio for the second time this year on November 25th but concerns mount over the country's outlook and the ability of monetary policy to effectively boost the economic recovery. Fresh data continues to point to a sharp slowdown due to covid restrictions, a property crisis and weakening global demand for Chinese goods. Data released during the weekend showed profits earned by China's industrial firms declined by 3% in the first ten months of 2022.

Madrid Stocks Edge UpSpain Stock Market
The IBEX 35 index was trading slightly above the 8,330 level on Tuesday, after starting the week in the red, in line with its regional peers, on expectations of reopening in China. A briefing was called by the Chinese government to give new details on the management of the pandemic leading to speculation about a progressive lifting of the restrictions in light of the recent protests. Meanwhile, investors were still assessing the evolution of inflation in major economies and new signals about the future actions of central banks. On the domestic data front, a preliminary estimate showed Spain's inflation unexpectedly eased to 6.8% in November 2022, from 7.3% in October and moving further away from July's 38-year high of 10.8%, mainly due to lower fuel and electricity prices. On the corporate front, Repsol was leading the gains, up 1.6%, tracking the increase in the prices of crude oil. Mapfre, Bankinter and ArcelorMittal also advanced more than 1% each.

Iron Ore Hovers at 2-Month HighCommodity
Prices for iron ore cargoes with a 63.5% iron ore content for delivery into Tianjin were at $100.5 per tonne, remaining close to the two-month high of $101.5 hit November 25th and set to close the month nearly 25% higher as expansionary measures from China to sustain a slowing economy outweighed concerns about protests against COVID related restrictions. The country’s largest commercial banks agreed to extend $162 billion in fresh credit lines to private developers to fight the property sector’s liquidity crunch, and the PBoC further cut banks' reserve requirement ratio. Earlier, the national bond authority expanded a key financing program by $35 billion to support the sales of bonds after a period of defaults increased the cost of credit for residence builders. Still, iron ore prices remain 36% below their 2022 peak hit in March as strict pandemic curbs in China hamper demand and risk fresh political unrest.

Euro on Track to Gain 5% in NovemberEuro Area Currency
The Euro traded around $1.04, close to levels not seen in near five months and is on track to end the November month near 5% higher, benefitting from a weaker dollar and falling US Treasury yields, as investors continue to bet the Fed will deliver a smaller 50bps rate increase next month, despite hawkish remarks from several officials. In Europe, the ECB remains committed to raise interest rates to dampen high inflation, and doubts persist whether the central bank will raise key borrowing costs by a 75bps for a third time when it meets next month while the peak rate is generally seen by investors around 3%. President Lagarde recently told the European Parliament that Euro zone inflation has not peaked and it risks turning out even higher than currently expected while many hawk policymakers have been advocating that room for slowing down interest rate increases is limited.

In the meantime, data showed that shipments from Malaysia during November 1-20 jumped between 2.9% and 9.6% from the same period in October, primarily due to higher sales to China and India.

European Natural Gas Holds SteadyCommodity
Dutch front-month natural gas futures remained near €125 MWh, and are on course for a only 1.3% monthly gain in November, as traders were monitoring supplies and weather forecast. On Monday, Gazprom continued to ship gas to Europe via Ukraine, and the company said it has decided against reducing gas supplies to Moldova, while reserving the right to lower or cut shipments if Moldova fails to make agreed payments. Last week, Gazprom warned it would curb supplies traveling through the pipeline crossing Ukraine from November 28th. Meanwhile, mild weather so far has helped to keep prices below record highs reached in August while gas storages in the EU were 94.6% full, and the total storage level in Germany was 99.3% as of November 22nd. Still, the situation remains challenging as a rapid surge in demand could pressure stocks while supply remains limited. On the political front, EU energy ministers agreed to postpone the approval of a proposed gas price cap at €275/MWh to mid-December.

Canadian Dollar Depreciates to 1-Week LowCanada Currency
The Canadian dollar weakened to 1.35 against the dollar, the lowest in a week, as risk-off sentiment seeped back into global markets and the latest data showed the country's current account balance swung to a deficit. Oil, one of Canada's major exports, was under pressure amid demand worries from top consumer China, though rumors of a possible production cut by OPEC+ in December provided a little boost to the commodity. On the macro front, Canada recorded a current account deficit of CAD 11.1 billion in Q3, the biggest gap in two years, and following surpluses in the first two quarters of 2022.

Meanwhile, widespread protests against strict COVID-19 restrictions in several Chinese cities sent shockwaves toward riskier assets, thus supporting the metal's appeal as a haven amid growing economic uncertainties.

DXY Edges UpUnited States Currency
The dollar edged up to 106.5 on Monday, slightly recovering from a 3-1/2-month low of 105.32 supported by safe-haven demand as investors fretted about global growth and reassessed the outlook for monetary policy. A substantial majority of Fed policymakers have been hinting that soon will be appropriate to slow the pace of interest rate hikes for the central bank to assess the economic landscape. However, Fed Bullard said markets may be underestimating the chances of higher rates and Fed Williams noted policymakers have more work to do to curb inflation. Earlier this month, the Fed delivered its fourth straight 75 basis point rate increase and pushed borrowing costs to the highest since 2008 to tame stubbornly high inflation. Money markets are now pricing in a 70% chance that the central bank would deliver a smaller 50-bps rate hike in December. At the same time, growing unrest in China over its strict COVID-19 restrictions added to worries about sluggish economic growth.

Oil Rebounds on Production Cut RumorsCommodity
WTI crude futures rebounded to above $77 per barrel on Monday, having hit an 11-month low of $73.50 earlier this session, as rumors of an OPEC+ production cut offset concerns about weak demand. Eurasia Group said major oil producers were considering a new production cut when they meet on December 4th, after in October agreed to reduce its output target by 2 million barrels per day through 2023. Protests against strict COVID-19 restrictions in some major Chinese cities, including Beijing and Shanghai, intensified during the weekend, exacerbating concerns about weaker growth and subdued demand for oil. At the same time, advanced economies, especially the US and Europe, are witnessing a drop in economic activity due to tightening financial conditions. Meanwhile, investors continued to track developments surrounding a G7 plan to impose a price cap on Russian oil.

Oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil were among the sharpest losers and fell 2.7% and 2.4%, respectively. Besides the possible European cap, widespread protests and strict lockdowns in Russia’s top oil importer, China, also added bearish pressure to the outlook of the sector.

Urea Falls to 14-Month LowCommodity
Urea prices fell to under $550 per tonne in the end of November, the lowest in 14 months, pressured by lower feedstock prices and the restart of production in main European producing hubs. The increased availability of natural gas in Europe since the start of the fourth quarter allowed manufacturers to restart production at significantly lowered input costs, allowing farmers to restock concerningly low reserves and erasing shortage worries. In the meantime, major importer India scooped up Russian fertilizers at discounted prices after the Kremlin snubbed export to Europe, freeing up supply from the Middle East to Eurasia. Previously, shortages of energy feedstock in Europe drove fertilizer manufacturers to shut down or operate well below capacity, risking shortages and sending urea prices to a record-high of $1050 per tonne in April. Supply was also jeopardized by the partial suspension of imports from major producers Russia and Belarus in retaliation to sanctions from the West.

Indian Rupee Steady Since Mid-NovemberIndia Currency
The Indian rupee stabilized at around 81.6 per USD in the second half of November, significantly stronger than the record low of 83 touched on October 19th as signals of slower rate hikes by Fed officials dampened demand for the dollar. In turn, expectations of slower tightening by the US central bank supported demand for riskier assets and ramped up dollar inflows to purchase Indian equities, supporting the rupee. On the policy front, investors expect the RBI to raise its key rate by 50bps in its next meeting, adding to the 180bps in interest rate hikes since the start of the bank’s tightening cycle in May. Still, relatively slow tightening by the Indian central bank, soaring inflation, and trade imbalances drove the rupee to depreciate 8.7% year-to-date.

Swiss Franc Approaches 3-Month HighSwitzerland Currency
The Swiss franc strengthened to the 0.94 per USD mark in the end of November, hovering at three-month highs with support from a weaker dollar as the slowing US economy drove Fed policymakers to signal lower rate hikes in upcoming meetings. In turn, hawkish signs from the Swiss National Bank continued to support the domestic currency. SNB Chairman Jordan stated that there is a high probability that the central bank will further tighten policy in the bank’s next decision, as current interest rates are low given the elevated inflation expectations. Pledges of tighter policy came despite the recent slowdown in price growth as annual inflation was at 3% in October, well below central bank expectations of 3.4% and August's 29-year peak of 3.5%. The SNB raised its policy rate by 75bps in its last meeting, lifting borrowing costs to positive territory for the first time since 2011.

Policymakers started raising rates in March 2021, pushing borrowing costs to a terminal level of 13.75% in August. As a result, Brazil's annual inflation rate eased to 6.47 percent in October 2022, the lowest reading in 19 months. The Brazilian real lost more than 4% in November, but it remains up roughly 5% since the beginning of 2022.

Rice Hits Over 2-Year HighCommodity
Rice futures rose above $18 per hundredweight, touching their highest levels since June 2020, supported by a fall in supply as well as expectations of rising demand from China and European countries. The USDA has lowered its 2022 US rice production forecast to 164.3 million hundredweight, about a million less than October’s report following a downward revision in the yield estimate. Global supplies were also reduced by 2.5 million tons to 686.8 million, on lower beginning stocks for India and smaller production for Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nigeria, and Sri Lanka. On top of that, prices of rice shipped from India edged up in November, as limited supplies are available for exporters amid aggressive government buying of paddy to encourage higher domestic output. In neighboring Bangladesh, rice prices have also remained elevated despite the government's latest efforts to stabilize the market, including allowing imports and duty cuts.

Sugar Retreats Further on Pressure from OilCommodity
Sugar futures on ICE fell to below 19.3 cents per pound, retreating further from the seven-month high of 20.3 cents touched on November 15th as the retreat in crude oil prices increased the opportunity cost of using cane feedstock to distill ethanol, driving producers to increase the crush of sugar. Still, prices remain over 7% higher from the start of the month as authorities in major sugar producer India reduced the export quota for the 2022/23 marketing year. The country will grant export permits for 6 million tons of sugar until May 2023, nearly half of the quota from the prior year. At the same time, investors continued to assess supply expectations for top producer Brazil amid the possibility that president-elect Lula could lift the country’s fuel price cap in January, further supporting prices.

Commodities Tumble on Chinese Demand WorriesCommodity
Most commodities sank on Monday, after protests against widespread lockdowns in China to curb rising coronavirus infections sparked demand concerns. Both Brent and Crude Oil futures were down as much as 5% in early Asian trading hours, falling below $80 and $74 per barrel respectively, and hitting the lowest level this year. Traffic in Chongqing, one of China’s biggest cities, was down by half from a year earlier on Monday morning, while in Beijing it was down 45%, and in Guangzhou, it was 35% lower. Meanwhile, copper and Iron Ore listed in Dalian fell as much as 2%. Also, cooking oil futures in Dalian dropped by as much as 3% as many hotels and restaurants remain closed.

Wheat Extends DeclineCommodity
Chicago wheat futures fell further to below $7.7 in late November, the lowest in over three months, pressured by continued shipments out of Ukrainian Black Sea ports. Following a period of supply uncertainty, Russia agreed to extend the UN-brokered deal that guarantees a trade corridor for vessels carrying Ukrainian grain in the Black Sea for another four months. According to Ukrainian authorities, the country was able to export more than 11 million tonnes of grain by ships since the start of the deal on August 1st, significantly easing shortage concerns in the next marketing year. In turn, extended supplies from the Black Sea are set to allow US players to build much-needed stocks in 2022-23. In the meantime, lower soybean demand expectations from China amid widespread lockdown protests could drive US farmers to allocate farmland to wheat instead, also increasing supply.

Silver Hovers Near Five-Month HighCommodity
Silver futures were trading around $21.5 per ounce, not far from a five-month high of around $22 reached on November 14th, backed by a combination of demand optimism and tight supplies. Global consumption of the white metal is expected to hit a new all-time high in 2022, driven by post-pandemic industrial and physical investment demand. At the same time, the world governments’ commitments to green technologies lifted the overall demand outlook for the commodity in the longer term. Signs of low supply also supported prices, as New York’s COMEX inventories fell 70% in the last 18 months to just over 1 million tonnes. Also, the London Bullion Market Association stockpiles fell for the 10th straight month to a record-low 27.1 thousand tonnes in November. Aside from the demand-supply dynamics, prospects of a less aggressive tightening from major central banks, particularly the Federal Reserve, have also lent optimism to silver bulls.

Gold Enjoys Wave of MomentumCommodity
Gold was changing hands around $1,760 per ounce on Monday, closing in on its highest levels since mid-August, spurred on by safe-haven demand stemming from the coronavirus situation in China and a weaker dollar. Widespread protests against strict COVID-19 restrictions in several Chinese cities sent shockwaves toward riskier assets, thus bolstering the metal's appeal as a haven amid growing economic uncertainties. Gold prices have already dramatically recovered from an over two-year low of around $1,600 touched in late September, amid increasing speculation that the Federal Reserve will soon slow the pace of interest rate hikes. Money markets are now pricing in a 70% chance that the central bank would deliver a smaller 50-bps rate hike in December.

India’s BSE Sensex closed 200 points higher at a fresh record of 62,500 on Monday, outperforming other Asian equity benchmarks as the decline in oil prices caused by widespread lockdown protests in China eased inflation expectations in India and offset contagion worries in industrial stocks.

UK Natural Gas Futures Fall Toward 1-Week LowCommodity
UK natural gas futures edged lower to 280 pence a therm in late November, approaching a one-week low and following a similar move in the European benchmark TTF, as Gazprom continued to ship gas to Europe via Ukraine, and the company said it has decided against reducing gas supplies to Moldova. Natural gas prices in the UK remain roughly 50% below a record closing of 640 reached in August, as above-average temperatures so far and strong wind output reduced demand. Also, LNG cargoes to north-west Europe, particularly Britain, remain strong, putting some pressure on prices. On the political front, EU energy ministers agreed to postpone the approval of a proposed gas price cap at €275/MWh to mid-December.

Austria Manufacturing Contracts for 4th MonthAustria Manufacturing PMI
The Unicredit Bank Austria Manufacturing PMI was unchanged at 46.6 in November 2022, remaining at its lowest level since June 2020 and pointing to a fourth straight month of contraction. The downturn was mainly led by the continued drop in inflows of new orders, although the rate of decline eased from October's 29-month record. Surveyed firms noted that demand for manufactured goods weakened due to high inflation, caution among clients, and lack of appetite for investment and full warehouses. On the price front, input price inflation eased to the slowest for nearly two years amid a further alleviation of supply-chain constraints, but remained high overall. Meanwhile, there were further increases in employment linked in part to the filling of job vacancies. Looking ahead, businesses were less pessimistic about the 12-month outlook, with expectations improving from October’s two-and-a-half year low. Still, firms worried about energy costs, high inflation and a broader economic slowdown.

The dollar weakened against a basket of major currencies on Monday, bottoming below the 106 mark and closing in on its lowest level since mid-August, as investors reassessed the outlook for monetary policy and growth.

At the same time, growing unrest in China over its strict COVID-19 restrictions added to worries about sluggish economic growth while denting risk appetite. The most pronounced selling activity was against the euro amid expectations of a narrow interest rate gap between the ECB and the Fed.

UK 10-Year Bond Yield Hovers Around 3.1%United Kingdom Government Bond 10Y
The yield on the UK’s 10-year Gilt steadied around 3.1%, remaining close to its lowest level since early September, on hopes that central banks might not end up hiking as aggressively as feared. Last week, Bank of England Deputy Governor Ramsden said he was backing more interest rate hikes, but would consider cutting rates if the economy developed differently to his expectation and persistence in inflation stopped being a concern. In addition, MPC member Tenreyro said earlier in the month she saw rates on hold next year and then falling in 2024, while Dhingra has warned that an over-tightening of policy could stoke a deep recession. Markets are betting on a 50 to 75 bps increase at the next December meeting. Elsewhere, US Fed officials agreed it would "likely soon be appropriate" to slow the pace of interest rate hikes. Investors have also welcomed the UK's budget announced on November 17th, which helped calm the markets following the turmoil triggered by Liz Truss's mini-budget.

Russian Stocks Drop for 3rd SessionRussia Stock Market
The ruble-based MOEX Russia index was 0.8% down to hover at the 2,180 mark on Monday, dropping for the third straight session as investors continued to monitor developments regarding price ceilings on Russian energy exports to the EU. Final talks in Brussels were delayed over the weekend, as policymakers attempt to agree on a price cap for Russian seaborne oil exports for the use of European tankers and insurance services on deliveries to Asia next week. Multiple states deemed the suggested price cap of $65-$70/barrel per barrel too lenient as Urals oil contracts hover at $66, while nations with large tanker industries advocated for higher caps. Oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil were among the sharpest losers of the session, trailing over 1% each. Besides the possible European cap, widespread protests and strict lockdowns in Russia’s top oil importer, China, also laid bearish pressure on the outlook of the sector.

Lithium Drops Further From RecordCommodity
Lithium carbonate prices in China fell further to CNY 577,500 per tonne from the record-high of CNY 597,500 hit November 11th, pressured by expectations of lower demand as investors eye the halt of subsidies for Chinese battery manufacturers at the start of 2023. In addition, demand is expected to slow further amid reports that cash subsidies and tax breaks for citizens purchasing electric vehicles are also expected to be canceled by the Chinese government in the upcoming months. Decarbonization goals in China and soaring demand for electric vehicles worldwide drove lithium prices to soar 108% year-to-date despite its pullback in November, underscored by an 81% yearly increase in new energy vehicle sales in October in the country. In the meantime, the US said it will grant $2.8 billion to US battery manufacturers to boost production, lifting the need for inputs. On the supply side, slower output in salt lake systems in China exacerbated battery manufacturers’ scrap for supplies.

German 10-Year Bond Yield Hovers Around 1.9%Germany Government Bond 10Y
German 10-year yields stabilized around 1.9%, remaining close to their lowest level since September 19th, as investors hoped that central banks might not raise interest rates as much as previously thought amid cooling inflation pressures and fears of a global economic downturn. All eyes turn to Wednesday's Eurozone CPI data, which is expected to show the first decline in headline inflation since mid-2020. The bloc's inflation was 10.6% in October, well above the ECB's 2% target. Last week, the ECB's meeting accounts showed that policymakers will continue tightening monetary policy to combat high inflation, even in the event of a shallow recession, but are willing to pause the ongoing interest rate hikes if there is a prolonged and deep recession. Elsewhere, the minutes from the Fed's latest meeting suggested it would likely soon be appropriate to slow the pace of interest rate hikes.

EU Gas Prices SteadyCommodity
Dutch front-month natural gas futures traded around €125 MWh on Monday, after gaining nearly 8% last week, as traders were weighing the possibility of tighter supply and cold weather. On Monday, Gazprom continued to ship gas to Europe via Ukraine, and the company said it has decided against reducing gas supplies to Moldova, while reserving the right to lower or cut shipments if Moldova fails to make agreed payments. Last week, Gazprom warned it would curb supplies traveling through the pipeline crossing Ukraine from November 28th. Meanwhile, mild weather so far has helped to keep prices below record highs reached in August while gas storages in the EU were 94.6% full, and the total storage level in Germany was 99.3% as of November 22nd. Still, the situation remains challenging as a rapid surge in demand could pressure stocks while supply remains limited. On the political front, EU energy ministers agreed to postpone the approval of a proposed gas price cap at €275/MWh to mid-December.

Gold Eases as Dollar GainsCommodity
Gold slipped to around $1,750 an ounce on Monday as the dollar recovered slightly on haven demand, as widespread protests against strict Covid restrictions in China roiled financial markets. Investors are also bracing for a slew of US economic reports to gauge the state of the world’s largest economy, as well as speeches by several Federal Reserve officials. Last week, the metal got a boost after the latest Fed meeting minutes showed that a substantial majority of US policymakers agreed it would soon be appropriate to slow the pace of interest rate hikes. Earlier this month, the Fed delivered its fourth straight 75 basis point rate increase and pushed borrowing costs to the highest since 2008 to tame stubbornly high inflation, and markets are now betting that it would moderate the size of its rate hike in December to 50 basis points. Gold is highly sensitive to the rates outlook as higher interest rates raise the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion, denting its appeal.
