Eswatini Hikes Key Rate to 6.5%Swaziland Interest Rate
The central bank of Eswatini decided to lift its benchmark interest rate by 50 bps to 6.5% at its November 2022 meeting. This marks the fifth straight rate hike this year, bringing borrowing costs to the highest since February of 2020. Policymakers said that inflationary risks to the outlook remain elevated due to the higher inflation outlook in South Africa, the country's major trading partner, which could be passed to domestic inflation through imports, among others. The overall inflation eased to 5.5% in October from 6.7% in September and it is still seen at 4.8% in 2022. Meanwhile, the Bank revised higher the forecasts for 2023 to 5.5% (vs previous 5.3%) and for 2024 to 5% (vs previous 4.8%).

Lithium Retreats Further from RecordCommodity
Lithium carbonate prices in China fell to CNY 582,500 per tonne from the record high of CNY 597,500 hit November 11th, pressured by expectations of lower demand as mounting Covid cases drove Beijing to ramp up restrictions for businesses and households. In the meantime, the cancellation of subsidies for battery manufacturers starting in 2023 limited demand for production inputs in new energy industries. Still, sustained bullish demand in the sector kept prices 109% higher year-to-date. Decarbonization goals in top consumer China drove local governments to pass cash incentives and tax breaks for the purchase of electric cars, contributing to an 81% yearly increase in new energy vehicle sales in October. In the meantime, the US said it will grant $2.8 billion to US battery manufacturers to boost production, lifting the need for inputs.

Russian Stocks Set for Weekly DeclineRussia Stock Market
The ruble-based MOEX Russia index was 0.7% down at 2,195 on Friday, set to close the week marginally lower as investors continued to monitor discussions regarding the EU’s price cap on Russian energy and the effect it may have on state energy revenues. Multiple EU states deemed the suggested cap range of $65-$70/barrel too lenient, as Urals oil price benchmarks hover at $66. Still, Greece and Malta argued for higher cap values to limit the impact on their shipping industry. While oil giants traded in Moscow edged lower in the session, Rosneft and Lukoil are set to close the week on the green as the price ceiling levels discussed could have a limited impact in the country’s oil revenues. In the meantime, Gazprom remained flat after announcing it plans to boost investments by 16% to RUB 2.3 trillion next year.

German 10-Year Bond Yield Remains Close to 2-Month LowGermany Government Bond 10Y
German 10-year yields stood at 1.9%, remaining close to their lowest level since September 19th and heading for their third straight weekly fall, as investors hoped that central banks might not raise interest rates as much as previously thought amid cooling inflation pressures and fears of a global economic downturn. Also, the gap between the 2-year and 10-year government bond yields touched -27 bps, the widest since October 1992, in a sign that investors expect the ECB to continue raising rates, before pausing or even cutting rates next year to support the economy. Earlier this week, the ECB's meeting accounts showed that policymakers will continue tightening monetary policy to combat high inflation, even in the event of a shallow recession, but they are willing to pause the ongoing interest rate hikes if there is a prolonged and deep recession. Elsewhere, the minutes from the Fed's latest meeting suggested it would likely soon be appropriate to slow the pace of interest rate hikes.

Meanwhile, banks agreed to extend $162 billion in fresh credit lines for private developers, and the PBoC cut the reserve requirement ratio by 25bps. Earlier, the national bond regulator expanded a major financing support program by $35 billion, also for private developers, aiming to counter the debt woes that hampered investments as the sector faced a period of record defaults.

UK 10-Year Bond Yield Stabilizes Around 3%United Kingdom Government Bond 10Y
The yield on the UK’s 10-year Gilt steadied around 3%, remaining close to its lowest level since early September, on hopes that central banks might not end up hiking as aggressively as feared. Earlier this week, the minutes of the Fed's November policy meeting showed that a "substantial majority" of policymakers agreed it would "likely soon be appropriate" to slow the pace of interest rate hikes. Elsewhere, investors digested remarks by few Bank of England officials. Deputy Governor Ramsden backed more interest rate hikes, but said he would consider cutting rates if the economy developed differently to his expectation and persistence in inflation stopped being a concern. MPC member Tenreyro said she saw rates on hold this year and then falling in 2024, while Dhingra has warned that an over-tightening of policy could stoke a deep recession. Markets are now split between pricing a 50 and 75 bps hike in December, after the central bank has raised rates by 290 bps since December 2021.

Annual producer inflation in Sweden eased to 18.7 percent in October 2022 from 20.6 percent in the previous month.

10-Year Treasury Yield Consolidates Around 3.7%United States Government Bond 10Y
The yield on the US 10-year Treasury note, seen as a proxy for global borrowing costs, consolidated around 3.7%, a level not seen since October 4th, as the narrative started to change from inflation and tightening to recession and the likelihood of a policy pivot. Minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting showed officials see the case for a slower pace of interest rate rises. The November meeting minutes also showed that policymakers were growing concerned about the economy's health, with officials noting that a recession is now almost as likely as their baseline projection of weak growth. This outlook for monetary policy is decoupling from the one seen for Europe, in which the ECB reassured markets that its tightening cycle is far over despite the continent heading for a recession in the last quarter of 2022. Germany's 10-year Bund yield, the European benchmark, rebounded from a two-month low to around 1.9%.

EU Natural Gas Prices to Book 8% Gain for the WeekCommodity
Dutch front-month natural gas futures traded around €125 MWh and were set to gain 8% on the week, as cold weather is approaching and supplies remain scarce.

However, the situation remains challenging as a rapid surge in demand could pressure stocks while supply remains limited. Gazprom warned it will curb supplies traveling through the pipeline crossing Ukraine from November 28th, which is the last remaining link still bringing Russian gas to western Europe. On the political front, European energy ministers agreed to postpone the approval of a proposed gas price cap at €275/MWh to mid-December.

The GfK Consumer Climate Indicator in Germany rose to -40.2 heading into December of 2022 from -41.9 in November, compared with market expectations of -39.6. The latest reading marked a further stabilization in sentiment amid government energy measures, with both economic conditions (-17.9 vs -22.2) and income expectations (-54.3 vs -60.5) increasing.

"On the one hand, some energy prices have recovered a bit, and on the other hand, consumers apparently assume the measures adopted to cap energy prices can help curb inflation, even if this may turn out to be rather modest.”

Japan 10 Year Government Bond Yield increased to a 4-week high of 0.26% after official data showed that Tokyo's core inflation rate hit its highest since April 1982 in November, due to high energy and food prices as well as persistent yen weakness.

Gold firmed up above $1,750 an ounce on Friday and was on track to end the week slightly higher as the latest Federal Reserve meeting minutes showed that a substantial majority of US policymakers backed a slower pace of interest rate hikes in the coming months. The central bank now wants to assess the impact of its historic tightening campaign on the economy after raising the policy rate in six consecutive meetings and bringing borrowing costs to the highest levels since 2008. Markets are betting that the Fed would moderate the size of rate hikes to 50 basis points in December after delivering its fourth straight 75 basis point increase earlier this month. Gold is highly sensitive to the rates outlook as higher interest rates raise the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion, denting its appeal.

The latest Fed meeting minutes showed that a substantial majority of policymakers agreed it would likely soon be appropriate to slow the pace of interest rate hikes. Earlier this month, the Fed delivered its fourth straight 75 basis point rate increase in an effort to tame stubbornly high inflation, pushing borrowing costs to the highest levels since 2008. The central bank now wants to assess the impact of its historic tightening campaign on the economy, with recent softness in US economic data supporting the case for more moderate moves. The dollar is set for a weekly loss against other major currencies, but remains up week-to-date against the Chinese yuan amid a worsening Covid outbreak in China.

Hang Seng Points to 2nd Straight Weekly LossesHong Kong Stock Market
The stock market in Hong Kong shed 139 points or 0.8% to 17.522 on Friday morning deals, halting gains from the prior two sessions while pointing to a 2.6% slump for the week, which would be the second straight weekly fall, pressured by the worsening COVID situation in China. Curbs reportedly are expanding across the mainland as daily cases hit a record high Thursday. In Beijing, normal life has been severely disrupted, with supermarket delivery apps being overwhelmed, amid growing fears of lockdown-like restrictions. At the same time, traders were unsure about the impact of the massive support from the government in the Chinese property sector, as developers remain wary of collecting enough cash via sales, bonds, or equity financing. Consumer cyclicals, tech, healthcare, and utilities, dragged down the index, amid sharp drops from Chow Tai Fook Jewelry (-12.2%), Haidilao Intl. (-4.7%), Zhongsheng Group (-4.4%), Tencent (-3.8%), Meituan (-3.4), Net Ease (-3.4%), and Baidu Inc. (-3.1%).

Oil Set to End Week LowerCommodity
WTI crude futures edged above $78 per barrel on Friday, but were still set to end the week lower due largely to concerns about Chinese demand and reports of a high price cap by G7 nations on Russian oil that eased supply worries. The US oil benchmark is down more than 2% this week, on track for the third straight weekly decline. China continued to grapple with surging Covid cases, stoking fears that authorities would adopt wider movement restrictions that could hurt energy demand in the world’s top crude importer. Meanwhile, markets evaluated the impact of the G7’s proposed price cap on Russian oil in the range of $65-70 per barrel which is higher than current prices for Urals, allaying fears that Russia would retaliate by cutting supply. Still, investors remain cautious ahead of the European Union ban on Russian crude on Dec. 5, as well as an OPEC+ meeting on Dec. 4.

UK Car Production Returns to Growth in OctUnited Kingdom Car Production
UK car production rose 7.4% to 69,524 units in October 2022 from a year ago, returning to growth after a slump in September, though production figures remain well below pre-pandemic levels as global chip shortages continued to affect British car manufacturers. SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said: “ A return to growth for UK car production in October is welcome, though output is still down significantly on pre-Covid levels amid turbulent component supply.” About 81% of output were exported, with the lion’s share going to the EU, and in smaller volumes to other countries such as the US, Japan, South Korea, Australia and Turkey. UK production of battery electric, plug-in hybrid and hybrid vehicles also rose, with combined volumes up 20.3% to 24,115 units.

Mexican Shares Close FlatMexico Stock Market
Mexico’s S&P/BMV IPC closed flat at 51,980 on Thursday, virtually holding gains after reaching a near six-month high in the prior session as losses for miners and banks offset losses for telecoms and consumer staples in muted trading due to Thanksgiving in the US. Domestically, investors digested minutes from the Bank of Mexico’s latest meeting, in which the bank raised interest rates by 75bps to a record-high 10%. Policymakers agreed that supply shocks affecting price growth were showing signs of easing, but that short-term inflation expectations remained on the upside. Previously, the central bank’s President Jonathan Heath said that the central bank is not ready to decouple from Fed’s policy decisions to ensure stability in the peso, suggesting it could also slow the pace of hikes in December. On the data front, headline mid-month inflation gauges were cooler than expected, while core readings accelerated more than forecasts predicted.

Tokyo Core Inflation Hits 40-Year HighJapan Tokyo Core CPI
The core consumer price index for the Ku-area of Tokyo in Japan surged 3.6% to 103.6 points in November 2022, the fastest pace in 40 years amid broadening inflationary pressures due to high raw material costs and a weak yen. Tokyo’s core inflation rate, a leading indicator of nationwide price trends, also exceeded forecasts for a 3.5% rise and followed a 3.4% gain in October. It exceeded the Bank of Japan’s 2% target for the sixth straight month as businesses continued to pass on higher costs to consumers. Still, the BOJ is widely expected to maintain ultra-loose monetary policy despite rising inflation and a weakening yen as it sees external factors driving such trends, while domestic wage growth and consumption remain soft.

Australia 10Y Bond Yield Hits 10-week LowAustralia Government Bond 10Y
Australia 10 Year Government Bond Yield decreased to a 10-week low of 3.542%, as less aggressive tightening by the Reserve Bank of Australia brought some respite to bond investors. The Reserve Bank of Australia raised the cash rate by only 25 bps in November and October, becoming one of the first banks in developed economies to moderate the pace of tightening amid a deteriorating outlook for growth, with policymakers noting that rates had already risen substantially. Still, the central bank mentioned that the tightening cycle was not over yet as inflation in Australia remains far higher than the RBA's target range of 2-3%. Meanwhile, the benchmark of US Treasury yield fell, after minutes from the recent meeting of the Federal Reserve signaled a slower pace of interest rate rises.

French 10-Year Bond Yield at Over 2-Month LowFrance Government Bond 10Y
The yield on the French 10-year OAT fell to 2.3% in the end of November, the lowest in more than two months and tracking bond yields worldwide as bets that the Fed will deliver slower rate hikes in upcoming meetings consolidated after the release of FOMC minutes. In the meantime, investors continued to assess the outlook for monetary tightening in the Euro Area amid continued signs of a slowing economy. Flash PMI data pointed to a fifth consecutive contraction for Eurozone private sector activity, while domestic activity contracted for the first time since February 2021. Still, ECB Board members emphasized that interest rates will continue to increase to curb record-high inflation in the currency bloc, even though the economy is heading towards a recession. Policymakers signaled that rates will rise by at least 50bps in the central bank’s December meeting, also leaving room for a more aggressive 75bps increase.

Italian Bond Yields Retreat FurtherItaly Government Bond 10Y
The yield on the Italian 10-year BTP fell further to below 3.7% in the end of November, the lowest in three months, and tracking lower bond yields worldwide after FOMC minutes showed that Fed officials agree in slowing the pace of interest rate hikes. Domestically, Prime Minister Meloni’s cabinet approved EUR 35 billion in increased spending, targeting Italy’s budget deficit to narrow to 4.5% in 2023 from 5.6% this year. The value remains below limits imposed by the EU and eased concerns that political instability in Italy could magnify the country’s high debt and fragile fiscal situation. In the meantime, bond markets continued to brace for another interest rate increase by the ECB despite further evidence of a slowing economy from PMI data, as bringing inflation down remains the priority for Board members. The spread between the 10-year BTP and the German bund narrowed to under 175bps, the least since May, pointing to lower perceived credit risk for Italian debt.

European Natural Gas Prices Halt 4-Day RiseCommodity
Dutch front-month natural gas futures fell more than 7% to €120 MWh, snapping a four-day winning streak, after European energy ministers agreed to postpone the approval of a proposed gas price cap at €275/MWh to mid-December. European gas prices have been rising this week on the first signs of cold weather and renewed supply concerns. On Tuesday, Gazprom warned it will curb gas traveling through Ukraine from November 28th, the last remaining pipeline still bringing Russian gas to western Europe. The transit cut will come at a time when temperatures are set to dip below average. Still, above-normal temperatures so far this year allowed gas storage sites to remain near complete creating a buffer for the winter. As of November 22nd, gas storages in the EU were 94.6% full, and the total storage level in Germany was 99.3%.

Lithium Eases from Record-HighCommodity
Lithium carbonate prices in China fell to CNY 590,500 per tonne from the record-high of CNY 597,500 hit November 11th as Chinese authorities will cancel subsidies for battery manufacturers at the start of 2023, slightly easing the soaring demand growth for input materials amid the boom in the sector. Prices were also pressured by the arrival of lithium from South America, easing concerns of supply deficits. Still, sustained bullish demand in the sector kept prices 113% higher year-to-date. Decarbonization goals in top consumer China drove local governments to pass cash incentives and tax breaks for the purchase of electric cars, contributing to an 81% yearly increase in new energy vehicle sales in October. In the meantime, the US said it will grant $2.8 billion to US battery manufacturers to boost production, lifting the need for inputs. On the supply side, slower output in salt lake systems in China exacerbated battery manufacturers’ scrap for supplies.

The move was driven by the Bank’s assessment that risks to the inflationary outlook remain skewed to the upside while the risks to the medium-term domestic growth outlook are assessed to the downside. Accordingly, inflation forecasts were revised slightly higher for this year and 2023, but lowered for 2024. Meanwhile, the central bank cut its growth forecast for the current year saying fourth-quarter growth will be impacted by power cuts as coal-fire state power utility Eskom struggles with power generation.

South Africa Hikes Key Interest Rate to 7%South Africa Interest Rate
The South African Reserve Bank raised its benchmark repo rate by another 75 bps to 7% at its November 2022 meeting, as widely expected. This is the 7th consecutive rate hike since policy normalization started in November 2021, to anchor inflation expectations more firmly around the mid-point of the target band and achieve the inflation target in 2024. South Africa's inflation rate unexpectedly rose to 7.6% in October from 7.5% in September, staying above the upper limit of the central bank's target range of between 3% and 6% for the sixth straight month. The headline CPI forecast was revised up to 6.7% in 2022 (vs 6.5% in September) and to 5.4% in 2023 (vs 5.3%) but lowered to 4.5% in 2024 (vs 4.6%). Moreover, core inflation estimates were left unchanged for this year at 4.3%, but revised higher to 5.5% in 2023 (vs 5.4%). Meanwhile, the GDP growth projections were cut to 1.8% in 2022 (vs 1.9%), 1.1% in 2023 (vs 1.4%) and 1.4% in 2024 (vs 1.7%), mainly due to rolling blackouts.

German 10-Year Bond Yield at Over 2-Month LowGermany Government Bond 10Y
German 10-year yields extended losses towards 1.8%, touching its lowest level since September 19th and tracking a drop in US yields the day before. Minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest meeting showed that a "substantial majority" of officials agreed it would likely soon be appropriate to slow the pace of interest rate hikes, even as inflation remains well above the central bank's target. Elsewhere, the European Central Bank's meeting accounts showed that policymakers will continue normalizing and tightening monetary policy to combat high inflation, even in the event of a shallow recession. Still, the minutes also suggested that the central bank might want to pause the ongoing interest rate hikes if there was a prolonged and deep recession, which would be likely to curb inflation to a larger extent. Eurozone's interest rates are seen peaking around 2.8% by the end of next summer.

ECB to Keep Raising Rates Despite Recession RisksEuro Area Interest Rate
European Central Bank policymakers agreed that the central bank should continue normalizing and tightening monetary policy to combat high inflation, even in the event of a shallow recession, the accounts of the central bank's October policy meeting showed. Officials noted that the inflation outlook continued to worsen, with inflation far too high and repeatedly above the projected figures, and that there was an increasing risk that it might become entrenched and that second-round effects and a wage-price spiral could emerge. Still, the central bank suggested that it might want to pause the ongoing interest rate hikes if there was a prolonged and deep recession, which would be likely to curb inflation to a larger extent. In October, the ECB raised its key interest rate by 75 bps, bringing borrowing costs to the highest since early 2009, and there was broad support for a meeting-by-meeting, data-dependent approach to taking future monetary policy decisions.

Turkish Shares Extend Record HighTurkey Stock Market
The Borsa Istanbul 100 index reached a record-high for a third straight session at 4,887 on Thursday, after the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey cut its key interest rate by another 150 basis points to 9% while stating it will end its current rate-cutting cycle. Investors have been using equity markets to hedge against Turkey’s surging inflation and plunging lira while residents sought assets to store their savings since the central bank started the rate-cut cycle in September 2021. Since then, the lira has plunged more than 100%, worsening inflationary pressures. Consumer inflation has jumped to 85.5% in October, the highest in 24 years, underpinned by largely negative real interest rates and costly measures to stabilize the currency amid intense pressure from President Tayyip Erdogan.

Iron Ore Hovers Close to 8-Week HighCommodity
Prices for iron ore cargoes with a 63.5% iron ore content for delivery to Tianjin were at $98 per tonne, not far from the eight-week high of $99.5 touched on November 18th and 20% higher since the beginning of the month amid fresh liquidity injections to steel consumers form top consumer China.

The move follows the national bond authority expanding a key financing program by $35 billion to support the sales of bonds in the sector after a period of defaults increased the cost of credit for residence builders. Still, prolonged recession fears due to pandemic curbs in China and eased supply concerns regarding Ukrainian exports maintained iron ore prices at 38% below their 2022 peak hit in March.

Nigeria GDP Growth Slows More than Expected in Q3Nigeria GDP Annual Growth Rate
The economy of Nigeria advanced by 2.25% from a year ago in the third quarter of 2022, decelerating from the second quarter’s 3.54% expansion and missing market estimates of a 2.95% rise. This marks the eighth consecutive quarter of growth but at the slowest rate since the first quarter of 2021, attributable to the base effects of the recession and the challenging economic conditions that have hampered productive activities. The non-oil sector, which has been the key engine of growth since late 2020, expanded at a softer pace of 4.27% in Q3 (vs 4.77% in Q2). Meanwhile, the oil sector shrank by 22.67%, after an 11.77% slump in the previous quarter, reflecting lower oil output as the average daily crude oil production stood at 1.20 million barrels per day, down from 1.43 mbps in Q2 and 1.57 mbps a year ago. Oil production in Nigeria has fallen to historic lows partly due to the unprecedented theft of its crude production from pipelines and fields in the Niger Delta region.

Turkey Slashes Rates, Signals End of Cutting CycleTurkey Interest Rate
The Central Bank of Turkey cut its interest rate by 150bps to 9% in its November 2022 meeting and stated that it will end its current rate-cutting cycle, as previously signaled. The decision added to the 10 percentage points in unorthodox rate curs since September of 2021 despite the lira’s plunge, soaring consumer prices, and an unbalanced current account. Inflation crossed 85% in October, the highest since 1998, largely due to surging costs of importing energy with an increasingly weak currency. The lira has plunged 55% since the start of the bank’s rate-cutting path last year to hover at record lows. Meanwhile, the TCMB’s board stated that the disinflation process to the 5% target should begin with further implementation of liraization measures that pursue currency and price stability, in addition to the resolution of geopolitical conflict.

Turkish Lira Holds At Record-Low After Rate CutTurkey Currency
The Turkish lira hovered at a record low past 18.6 per USD, after the central bank cut interest rates by another 150 bps in November, pushing borrowing costs to the lowest since August of 2020. The TCMB slashed its key rate by 1000 bps since September 2021 demanded by President Erdogan to stimulate growth in industry and exports. Yet, the bank signaled the November cut would be the end of its current rate-cutting cycle. Inflation hit a 24-year high of 85.5% in October, as the low purchasing power of the local currency exacerbated price pressure from surging energy costs that Turkey must import. Also, the latest current account swung to a sharp deficit, and the trade gap quintupled from the corresponding periods of the previous year, contradicting Erdogan’s pledge that Turkey would consolidate a strong surplus position.

Besides private construction, building starts by non-developers were seen 30% higher in the first nine months of the year, also supporting demand. Still, bearish pressure from pandemic woes remains, after Covid deaths and consequent lockdowns weighed against previous expectations of reopening measures and pressed on hopes that steel-intensive sectors of construction and infrastructure would pick up next year.

Heating Oil Eases, But Poised For More GainsCommodity
Heating oil futures were trading around the $3.3 per gallon mark, down from their June peak of $4.4, as increased domestic output helped ease some concerns about tight supplies. Refinery production increased last week, with EIA data showing that heating oil stockpiles rose 0.961 barrels. Still, the commodity remains up more than 40% since the beginning of the year, outperforming its peers, with solid demand and low inventories pushing prices higher. In the United States, diesel and heating oil inventories have been hovering at record low levels for this time of year, with shortages along the East Coast forcing suppliers to ration and initiating emergency protocols. At the same time, in northwest Europe, stockpiles are forecasted to hit a low in November and then narrow even more by March, as the EU restrictions on importing most Russian crude oil and refined products come into force on Dec. 5 and Feb. 5, respectively.

Also, the Riksbank will allow its holdings of securities to decrease in line with maturities starting early next year.

By contrast, luxury stocks posted the biggest losses, with Kering losing 0.8% after the group confirmed on Wednesday the departure of Gucci creative director Alessandro Michele. Meanwhile, Remy Cointreau slipped 3.7% after the maker of Remy Martin cognac said the second-half would reflect a return to normal consumption trends after two years of "exceptional growth".

Chinese Yuan Steadies Amid Mixed CuesChina Currency
The offshore yuan steadied around 7.15 per dollar, remaining in a sideways trading range as traders weighed the prospect of a slower pace of US Federal Reserve tightening against expectations for more monetary easing from China’s central bank. The latest Fed meeting minutes showed that a majority of US policymakers agreed it would likely soon be appropriate to slow the pace of interest rate hikes. Meanwhile, top officials in China signaled more monetary stimulus ahead to support its Covid-stricken economy, including a possible cut to the reserve requirement ratio. The People’s Bank of China kept its benchmark lending rates unchanged for the third straight month in November as a weakening currency and persistent capital outflows left it little room to ease policy. The world’s second-largest economy has also been struggling to contain resurgent Covid outbreaks since adopting a targeted approach, with daily virus infections hitting new record highs.

Oil Pressured by China Demand FearsCommodity
WTI crude futures held below $78 per barrel on Thursday after closing at a two-month low in the previous session, remaining under pressure as surging Covid cases in China stoked fears of even tighter movement restrictions that could hurt energy demand in the world’s top crude importer. Investors also weighed a larger-than-expected build in US gasoline stocks, which jumped by 3.058 million barrels last week despite forecasts for a 383,000 barrel gain, though US crude inventories dropped significantly. Meanwhile, markets evaluated the impact of the G7’s proposed price cap on Russian oil in the range of $65-70 per barrel, higher than current prices for Urals. Analysts suggested that a high cap may have minimal effect on markets as it would likely not disrupt Russian flows. Still, investors remained cautious as OPEC could further intervene in markets to cope with a recession-driven demand downturn.

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka left its benchmark interest rates at a record high of 14.5% during its November meeting, as widely expected, amid ongoing efforts from the central bank and government to tame surging inflation. The board said that the current accommodative monetary policy stance was appropriate to achieve the envisaged disinflation path in the period ahead and bring down inflation to the targeted level of 4-6% over the medium term while supporting the economy to reach its potential over the medium term. The annual inflation rate eased to 66% in October of 2022, from a record 69.8% in September, due to an economic and political crisis and a plunging currency. The board also kept the Standing Lending Facility Rate at 15.5%.

That was the ninth rate increase since the central bank started tightening policy in August 2021 and brought the key rate to the highest level since June 2012. The BOK opted for a more moderate move after raising borrowing cost by a full percentage point in the previous two meetings as it seeks to bring down inflation without sacrificing economic growth. The won plunged to an over 13-year low last month as the US Federal Reserve embarked on a historic tightening campaign and as South Korea’s economy faced external and domestic headwinds. Meanwhile, the currency has recovered nearly 10% since amid bets for a slower pace of Fed rate hikes and a stronger domestic economic outlook.

South Korea Lifts Base Rate by 25Bps to 3.25%South Korea Interest Rate
Bank of Korea (BoK) raised its base rate by 25bps to 3.25% during its November meeting, matching market consensus. Thursday's move brought borrowing costs to their highest level since June 2012 and came after the central bank delivered two half-point hikes this year as it sought to keep pace with the US Fed and stem the fall of the local currency. The BoK opted to slow the pace of tightening, amid efforts to minimize pressure on the economy and credit market while keeping inflation in check. The latest decision was the sixth straight interest hike and the ninth increase since August 2021 when the central bank began rolling back over a year of its accommodative policy. Policymakers said 2022 GDP growth will be consistent with the August forecast of 2.6%, but that for next year is projected to be 1.7%, considerably lower than the August forecast of 2.1%, due to mounting global headwinds and high-interest rates. Meantime, headline inflation is seen to be 5.1% in 2022 and 3.6% in 2023.

Fed Considers Slower Rate Increases to Be AppropriateUnited States Interest Rate
A substantial majority of Fed officials judged that a slowing in the pace of the fed funds rate increase would likely soon be appropriate, as it would better allow the Committee to assess progress toward its goals of maximum employment and price stability, minutes from the November 1-2 FOMC meeting showed. Policymakers also noted that with inflation showing little sign of abating, and with supply and demand imbalances in the economy persisting, the ultimate level of the federal funds rate that would be necessary to achieve the Committee's goals was somewhat higher than they had previously expected. The Federal Reserve raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 75bps to 3.75%-4% during its November 2022 meeting, marking a sixth consecutive rate hike and the fourth straight three-quarter point increase, pushing borrowing costs to a new high since 2008.

In a day soft in terms of economic data, investors focused on the US Federal Reserve meeting minutes that could offer clues on the central bank's future tightening plans. Ocado Group and Hargreaves Lansdown were among the biggest gainers on the index, up 5% and 4%, respectively.

Russian Shares Extend ReboundRussia Stock Market
The ruble-based MOEX Russia Index closed 0.7% higher at 2,212 on Wednesday, extending last session’s rebound as investors monitored the extent of measures against Russian energy exports from the European Union and its effect on state revenues. The EU is set to halt seaborne oil shipments to Europe and allow the use of European tankers and insurance services to Asia below a price cap, previously speculated to range between $65-$70 per barrel. Still, Russian authorities have pledged that no sales will be allowed for any country that complies with the cap, jeopardizing much-needed energy revenues for the state. At the same time, the EU proposed a ceiling on natural gas prices at €275 for TTF contracts, well above current prices. Oil producers and gas giant Gazprom closed between 0.5%-1% higher, as restrictions were not deemed worse than expectations. The latter announced it could cut gas flows through its last remaining pipeline to Europe next week, citing storage disputes with Moldova.

Crude Oil Plunges Almost 5%Commodity
WTI crude futures plunged almost 5% to below $77 per barrel, closing in on its lowest level since January, as investors mulled persistent demand concerns while following developments regarding G7's price cap on Russian oil. A deteriorating outlook for global demand has been keeping markets on edge, with advanced economies, mainly the US and Europe, seeing a drop in economic activity due to tightening financial conditions and top crude importer China's facing the possibility of tighter coronavirus-induced restrictions amid rising infections. At the same time, the G7 looked at a price cap on Putin's oil above where the crude grade is currently trading, making it profitable for Russia to sell its crude and preventing a supply shortage on the international market. Putting a floor under prices were hopes that OPEC could further intervene in markets to cope with a recession-driven demand downturn. EIA data also showed a much bigger-than-expected drop in US inventories last week.

US stocks managed to rebound from a sour opening on Wednesday, with the blue-chip Dow adding 100 points and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq up 0.5% and 1%, respectively, as weaker-than-expected economic data reinforced bets that the Federal Reserve will soon slow its aggressive tightening campaign. US business activity contracted for a fifth straight month in November, with a measure for manufacturing dipping below the 50 mark for the first time since 2020. At the same time, a different report showed that weekly claims rose more than expected to a three-month high last week.

New home sales in the United States rose by 7.5% to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 632K in October of 2022, beating market forecasts of 570K sales and defying the recent drawdown in housing demand as the Federal Reserve aggressively tightens monetary policy.

US Service Sector Contracts at Faster Rate in NovemberUnited States Services PMI
The S&P Global US Services PMI fell to 46.1 in November 2022, down from 47.8 in October and missing market expectations of 47.9, a preliminary estimate showed. The reading pointed to the second-fastest rate of contraction in the service sector, excluding the initial pandemic phase in the first half of 2020, as high inflation and rising interest rates hit demand. New business dropped the most since May 2020 and employment rose only marginally, while backlogs of work and capacity pressure were down. On the price front, input cost inflation was the softest in almost two years and output price inflation was the lowest since October 2020. Nonetheless, firms remained upbeat in their expectations for activity over the next year, amid hopes of further easing in price pressures and investment in service lines.

The S&P Global US Composite PMI dropped to 46.3 in November 2022 from 48.2 in the previous month, signaling the sharpest pace of contraction in the private sector since August and among the quickest since 2009, a preliminary estimate showed. New orders fell the most since the initial pandemic wave in May 2020 as the impact of high inflation and rising borrowing costs weighed on demand, while the pace of job creation was only marginal. On the price front, input cost inflation softened for the sixth month running to the lowest since December 2020, but remained high overall, and selling price inflation eased to an over two-year low. Nonetheless, business expectations improved in November, amid improvements in supply chain stability and hopes of greater client demand following new product launches.

US Factory Activity Falls for 1st Time since 2020United States Manufacturing PMI
The S&P Global US Manufacturing PMI fell to 47.6 in November of 2022 from 50.4 in October, well below forecasts of 50. The reading pointed to the first contraction in factory activity since the pandemic hit in mid-2020, preliminary estimates showed. There was a renewed fall in output and a sharper decline in new orders as demand conditions were stymied by inflation and economic uncertainty. On the other hand, firms signalled the first improvement in supplier performance since October 2019. Faster lead times were, however, often linked to reduced demand for inputs. Moreover, purchasing activity fell at the sharpest pace since May 2020 as firms reportedly worked through excess inventories. Both input and output price inflation eased and employment slowed as difficulties in finding skilled labor continued. Finally, business confidence improved from October’s recent low.

All three major US stock indexes opened Wednesday's session virtually flat as investors remained reluctant to open new positions ahead of the release of minutes of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting that may provide insight into its tightening plan. Recent remarks from Fed officials, including Cleveland President Loretta Mester and his Kansas counterpart Esther George, have offered mixed hints about the central bank's rate path but have reiterated that a pause is still premature. Money markets are pricing a 75% chance of a 50-bps hike in December. On the corporate side, Deere & Co jumped 5% after the world's largest farm equipment company reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit. Conversely, Nordstrom dropped over 8% after the fashion retailer offered weak guidance. Meanwhile, weekly claims rose more than expected to a three-month high last week, while durable goods orders beat estimates in October.

US Natural Gas Futures Rise to 2-Month HighCommodity
US natural gas futures jumped by over 10% to above $7.5/MMBtu mark, the highest in two months, on prospects of more robust domestic and international demand ahead of the upcoming winter season. The Freeport LNG export plant in Texas, forced offline in June following a fire, expects to begin bringing operations back online in mid-December, at the same time as Europe is clamoring for US exports after Russia threatened to cut supplies even further. On top of that, workers at the largest US rail union voted against a tentative contract deal reached in September, raising the possibility of a year-end strike that could disrupt coal deliveries and force power generators to burn more gas. Meanwhile, a federal report is expected to show a bigger-than-usual storage draw last week when colder-than-normal weather boosted heating demand, likely pushing stockpiles to 3.557 trillion cubic feet, or 1.3% below the five-year average of 3.603 tcf for this time of the year.

Kenya Lifts Interest Rate to 8.75%Kenya Interest Rate
The central bank of Kenya raised its benchmark interest rate by 50 bps to 8.75% at its November 2022 meeting, in line with market forecasts. It marks the third straight rate hike this year, bringing borrowing costs to the highest since late 2019. Policymakers noted the sustained inflationary pressures, the elevated global risks and their potential impact on the domestic economy and concluded that there was scope for a further tightening of the monetary policy in order to anchor inflation expectations. The annual inflation rate in Kenya accelerated for the eighth straight month to a fresh 5-year high of 9.6% in October of 2022, from 9.2% in September. Meanwhile, the recently released GDP data for the second quarter together with leading indicators of economic activity suggest that the Kenyan economy should remain strong in 2022.

Traders continued to monitor negotiations around the Transition PEC, whose final text is set to be presented today, while also awaiting the release of FOMC minutes later in the day. In the draft of the PEC delivered by the transition team last week, around BRL 200 billion was expected to be extra ceiling and without an expiry date for program expenses to return within the spending cap. However, alternative proposals to the Transition PEC, with shorter deadlines and expenses, were presented in recent days by senators. Meanwhile, former Brazil president Jair Bolsonaro on Tuesday blamed a software bug and demanded the electoral authority annul votes cast on most of Brazil’s nation’s electronic voting machines, more than three weeks after losing a reelection bid.

In the latest commentary, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly warned against overtightening, while Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said she wants to see inflation come down sustainably before supporting a pause. On the macro front, fresh figures showed weekly claims rose more than expected to a 3-month high last week while durable goods orders beat estimates in October.

US Initial Jobless Claims at 3-Month HighUnited States Initial Jobless Claims
The number of American filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose by 17,000 to 240,000 on the week ending November 19th, the most since August and well above expectations of 225,000 likely boosted by the wave of layoffs in technology companies. Also, last week's rise may be technical as the model used by the government to adjust the data for seasonal fluctuations typically anticipates a rise in filings because of temporary company closures related to the holidays. On a seasonally unadjusted basis, initial claims soared by 47,909 to 248,185, with significant increases in Illinois (+7,306), California (+5,024), and Georgia (+3,434).

Flash PMI data pointed to a fifth consecutive contraction for Eurozone private sector activity, while domestic activity contracted for the first time since February 2021.

The yield on the Italian 10-year BTP fell further to below 3.9% in the fourth week of November, the lowest in over two months and moving opposite to European bond yields as investors digested the new Italian government’s budget document. Prime Minister Meloni’s cabinet approved EUR 35 billion in increased spending, targeting Italy’s budget deficit to narrow to 4.5% in 2023 from 5.6% this year, remaining well below limits imposed by the EU and easing concerns that political instability in Italy could magnify the country’s high debt and fragile fiscal situation. In the meantime, bond markets continued to brace for another interest rate increase by the ECB despite further evidence of a slowing economy from PMI data, as bringing inflation down remains the priority for Board members. The spread between the 10-year BTP and the German bund narrowed to under 190bps, the least since July, pointing to lower perceived credit risk for Italian debt.

It is the first time in four months that borrowing costs fall for two consecutive weeks and now stand at their lowest level in eight weeks, tracking a retreat in bond yields. Still, mortgage rates remain close to levels not seen since 2001, and more than double the 3% reported a year earlier.

The purchase index went up 2.8% and applications to refinance a home loan increased 1.8%. Meanwhile, the 30-year mortgage rate went down by 23bps to 6.67%, the lowest in eight weeks. “The decrease in mortgage rates should improve the purchasing power of prospective homebuyers, who have been largely sidelined as mortgage rates have more than doubled in the past year,” said Joel Kan, an MBA economist. Compared to the previous year however, refinance applications are still 86% lower while mortgage applications to purchase a home were 41% down.

According to Ukrainian authorities, the country was able to export more than 11 million tonnes of grain by ships since the start of the deal on August 1st, significantly easing shortage concerns in the next marketing year. In turn, extended supplies from the Black Sea are set to allow US players to build much-needed stocks in 2022-23.

A deteriorating outlook for global demand has been keeping markets on edge, with advanced economies, mainly the US and Europe, seeing a drop in economic activity due to tightening financial conditions and top crude importer China's facing the possibility of tighter coronavirus-induced restrictions amid rising infections.

OPEC's de-facto leader Saudia Arabia has recently reassured investors that it is ready to reduce production further to balance supply and demand if needed. On top of that, an EU ban on Russian crude imports from December 5th and an imminent G7 price cap on Putin's oil exacerbated concerns about tighter supplies.

Russian 10-Year Bond Yield at 2-Week HighRussia Government Bond 10Y
The yield on the 10-year OFZ bond rose to 10.1% in November, the highest in two weeks, as investors digested the country’s credit risk after the federal government changed the budget law to account for increased military spending. The amendment signed by President Putin allocated RUB 8 trillion from higher taxes in oil and gas revenues for 2023-25, in line with estimates that assume the ruble should hold between 65-75 per USD, but raising concerns of stable financing depending on the rigidity of energy embargos by the West. The budget assumes a deficit of 2% of GDP in 2023 and 1.4% in 2024, wiping out the strong surplus position observed in the first three quarters of 2022. The document also assumed RUB 2.9 trillion to be used from Russia’s rainy-day National Welfare Fund, an unprecedented move that underscores the unsustainability of higher spending. Lastly, yields were supported by increased OFZ auctions for further fiscal support ahead of the start of the EU’s oil embargo.

Zambia Keeps Key Interest Rate at 9%Zambia Interest Rate
The Central Bank of Zambia left its key interest rate at 9% at its November 2022 meeting, for the fourth time in a row this year, citing the continued downward trend in inflation. Zambia's annual inflation rate eased to a four-month low of 9.7% in October of 2022 from 9.9% in the prior month, helped by the relative stabilization of the kwacha. However, policymakers said the current projection shows that inflation will follow a slightly higher path than was anticipated at the August meeting, amid the adverse global economic environment. Accordingly, inflation is now expected to average 11.3% in 2022 (vs 11.4% in August) and 8.5% in 2023 (vs 8.4%), before falling back within the bank's 6%-8% target range during the first quarter of 2024. The real GDP growth is now seen at 3% in 2022, down from a 3.1% projection in August, before the expected acceleration to 4% in 2023 and 4.1% in 2024.

South Africa Business Morale Drops Further in Q4South Africa Business Confidence
The RMB/BER business confidence index in South Africa fell for the third consecutive quarter to 38 in the fourth quarter of 2022, the lowest since the first quarter of 2021. Whilst sentiment deteriorated among wholesalers (37 vs 50 in Q3) and retailers (42 vs 51), it improved sharply for constructors (46 vs 29) thanks to seasonal factors. "There is no denying the fact that the economy would be doing so much better were it not for the slow pace that continues to describe the government's efforts in addressing growth-damaging constraints such as insufficient electricity, poorly functioning ports and a failing railway network," RMB chief economist Ettienne Le Roux said.

Iceland Raises Key Rate by 25bpsIceland Interest Rate
The Central Bank of Iceland raised its key interest rate, the rate on seven-day term deposits, by 25bps to 6% in its November 2022 meeting.

The Monetary Policy Committee noted that underlying inflation has continued to rise and that inflation expectations have become less firmly anchored to the target, while the krona has depreciated since their last meeting. Members forecast inflation in Iceland to average 9.4% in the fourth quarter and begin to gradually ease in 2023 to end next year at 4.5%.

EU Natural Gas Prices Continue to RiseCommodity
Dutch front-month natural gas futures advanced almost 10% to €131 MWh on Wednesday, the highest level in a month and extending gains for a fourth session as supply concerns reemerged again. On Tuesday, Gazprom warned it will curb gas traveling through Ukraine from November 28th, the last remaining pipeline still bringing Russian gas to western Europe. The transit cut will come at a time when temperatures are set to dip below average. On the other hand, above-normal temperatures so far this year allowed gas storage sites to remain near complete creating a buffer for the winter. As of November 20th, gas storages in the EU were 95% full, and the total storage level in Germany was 100%. Meanwhile, EU energy ministers are set to meet tomorrow to discuss the price cap proposal. The current European Commission proposal for €275 per megawatt-hour upper cap on TTF gas prices, is too high for many countries to accept and makes little difference.

Oil Climbs on Supply UncertaintiesCommodity
WTI crude futures rose above $81 per barrel on Wednesday, extending gains from the previous session as supply-side uncertainties overshadowed demand concerns. Investors awaited further details on G7 plans to cap Russian oil and worried about how Russia would respond after it previously stated that it won’t sell crude to countries that adopt such measures. In the US, industry data showed that US crude inventories dropped by 4.2 million barrels last week, much higher than forecasts for a 2.2 million barrel draw. The US oil benchmark was also lifted after the UAE, Kuwait, Iraq and Algeria backed claims by Saudi Arabia’s energy minister that OPEC+ was not considering increasing output. Meanwhile, demand concerns stemming from top crude importer China’s Covid woes and rising global interest rates kept oil prices from further gains.

NZ Dollar Jumps as RBNZ Delivers 75bp Rate HikeNew Zealand Currency
The New Zealand dollar jumped toward $0.62 on Wednesday, approaching its strongest levels in nearly three months after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand delivered a supersized 75 basis point rate hike to get ahead of inflation. That was the biggest increase since the RBNZ introduced the OCR in 1999 and brought the policy rate to a 14-year high of 4.25%. The RBNZ also expects the cash rate to peak at 5.5% in September 2023 according to its latest forecasts. Stubbornly high inflation and near-record low unemployment in New Zealand supported the case for a more aggressive move, in contrast to other major economies which have started to slow the pace of tightening amid growing risks of a global recession. Finance Minister Grant Robertson also said that the country was well positioned to withstand a global recession due to robust growth and a stable financial system.

New Zealand Delivers Record Rate HikeNew Zealand Interest Rate
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand raised its official cash rate (OCR) by 75bps to the highest since January 2009 of 4.25% during the November meeting, in line with market consensus. Wednesday's move was the biggest rate hike in the central bank's history, as it continues efforts to curb high inflation ahead of a three-month break. It was also the 9th straight increase, meaning that the OCR has now risen 400bps since October 2021, the most aggressive tightening by the RBNZ since 1999. The board said core consumer price inflation was too high, employment was beyond its sustainable level, and near-term inflation expectations had risen. The committee flagged more rate hikes to come, seeing the OCR would peak at 5.5% in September 2023. Policymakers projected that the economy will start contracting in Q2 of 2023 and continue declining until Q1 of 2024. Minutes from the meeting showed the central bank even considered a full percentage point hike.

Singapore Q3 GDP Annual Growth Revised LowerSingapore GDP Annual Growth Rate
Singapore’s GDP grew by 4.1% yoy in Q3 of 2022, compared with the flash figure of 4.4% and market estimates of 4.3%. The manufacturing sector rose much softer (0.8% vs 5.6% in Q2), amid falls in electronics, chemicals, and biomedical clusters. Meantime, construction activity increased the most in a year (7.8% vs 4.8%), with both public and private sectors rising. Also, growth in the services sector was solid (5.82% vs 5.0%), due to a pickup in the output of both wholesale trade and food & beverages as well as a further rise in retail trade, transport, real estate, information, and other services. The government expects the city economy to advance by around 3.5% in 2022, compared with earlier projections of between 3 to 4%. For next year, the GDP is estimated to slow between 0.5 to 2.3%, on global headwinds that would hit demand for trade and finance.

Paraguay Maintains Interest Rate at 8.5%Paraguay Interest Rate
At its November meeting, the Monetary Policy Committee (CPM) unanimously decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 8.50% per year. The CPM cited the following reasoning: on the international stage, the prospects for world economic growth for 2023 have continued to deteriorate, in a context of upward adjustments in reference rates in advanced countries and the continuation of restrictions in China to contain outbreaks of COVID-19 cases. Regarding commodities, the international prices of crude oil, wheat, and corn have fallen in recent weeks.

Nigeria Hikes Key Interest Rate to 16.5%Nigeria Interest Rate
The Central Bank of Nigeria lifted its monetary policy rate by 100 bps to 16.5% at its November 2022 meeting, following a 150bps hike in September, matching market expectations. This represents the fourth straight rate increase so far this year, citing the risk of slowing growth amid persistent inflationary pressures. Nigeria's headline inflation rate accelerated for the ninth straight month to hit an over 17-year high of 21.1% in October, amid increases in the cost of imported products due to currency depreciation and rising energy costs. Meanwhile, policymakers noted that recent developments in terms of observed month-on-month deceleration in the rate of increase in inflation suggest that the previous tightening policies were yielding the expected outcome. Available data on key macroeconomic indicators point to continued growth for the rest of 2022, which may occur at a much slower pace than earlier anticipated, in the light of unfolding domestic and external shocks to the economy.

Currently, the instrument to combat soaring inflation and the weakening forint is the newly-created one-day deposit facility with an interest rate of 18%, also unchanged in the meeting, effectively replacing the base rate. The facility was created as the weakening local currency and high energy prices drove Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban to pressure the central bank to enact emergency measures, also leading the NBH to hike its overnight collateralized lending rate by 950 basis points to 25% in October. In October, the annual inflation rate in Hungary rose to 21.1%, the highest in 26 years. Meanwhile, the forint is down 18% against the dollar year-to-date.

Silver Rebounds from 2-Week LowCommodity
Silver futures rose to over $21.2 per ounce, rebounding from the two-week low of $20.8 touched on November 21st with support from a slight retreat in the dollar ahead of the FOMC minutes release. Besides supporting bullion, hesitancy by the Fed to maintain the pace of its sharp tightening cycle would lift prices due to higher demand for industrial silver usage through electrical conductors. Signs of low supply also lifted prices, as inventories at New York’s COMEX fell 70% in the last 18 months to just over 1 million tonnes. Also during the period, stocks at the London Bullion Market Association fell for the 10th straight month to a record-low 27.1 thousand tonnes.

German 10-Year Bond Yield Holds Around 2%Germany Government Bond 10Y
The yield on Germany's 10-year government bond held around 2%, well below the 11-year high of 2.5% hit on October 21st as investors weighed mixed signals from European Central Bank policymakers on the course of monetary tightening. ECB President Lagarde said the central bank would keep raising rates to combat inflation despite risks of recession, while policymaker Holzmann said he would favor a third straight 75 bps rise in the deposit rate next month. At the same time, other ECB officials suggested the central bank could slow its pace of rate hikes. Investors are now expecting a 50 basis-point hike in December, and see the reduction of bond holdings starting in the first half of 2023. Last week, the ECB announced that Eurozone banks are set to repay €296 billion in multi-year loans from the ECB this week, less than the €500 billion expected by markets, in the first voluntary repayment window of the ECB's TLTRO since terms were changed in October.

US Stock Futures WaverUnited States Stock Market
Stock futures contracts tied to the three major indices were trading around the flatline with some positive bias on Tuesday as investors digested a slew of Fed speeches while remaining cautious ahead of the FOMC November minutes release later this week. The Federal Reserve has recently thrown cold water into expectations that it will soon pause its aggressive tightening campaign. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly and her Cleveland counterpart Loretta Mester were among the latest officials to echo this view, although signaling support for a smaller 50 bps hike in December. Aside from the Fed, the sentiment was clouded by growth concerns, particularly in China, where renewed coronavirus outbreaks dashed hopes for a swift reopening of the world's largest economy.

Euro Holds Above $1.02 on Mixed Signs from ECB OfficialsEuro Area Currency
The euro held above $1.02, remaining close to its strongest level in over five months, as investors weighed mixed signals from European Central Bank policymakers on their stance on interest rates against the prospect of weakening global growth and the return of tougher restrictions in China. ECB President Lagarde said last week the central bank would keep raising rates as inflation in the Eurozone remained far above the 2% target, and even a recession is seen as unlikely to ease price pressures enough to let the ECB step off the brakes. Meanwhile, policymaker Holzmann backed a third straight 75 bps rise in the deposit rate next month, while other ECB officials suggested the central bank could slow its pace of rate hikes. Investors are now expecting a 50 bps hike in December after the central bank has raised rates by an unprecedented 200 bps since July. In addition, the reduction of the ECB's €5 trillion debt holding is seen starting in the first half of 2023.

As of November 20th, gas reserves in the EU were 95% full, and the total storage level in Germany was 100%. The unseasonal warmer front in Europe created a large safeguard for the usage of natural gas in storage for colder months ahead, while EU member states continue discussions to limit spikes in gas prices. The European Commission is expected to propose introducing a gas price cap for one year from January 1, 2023. The actual ceiling level, however, is not agreed upon yet.

Iron Ore Eases from 8-Week HighCommodity
Prices for iron ore cargoes with a 63.5% iron ore content for delivery to Tianjin eased to $97 per tonne from the eight-week high of $99.5 from November 18th, as rising Covid cases and recommenced casualties raised fears of extended lockdowns in top consumer China. Prolonged recession fears due to pandemic curbs in China and eased supply concerns regarding Ukrainian exports drove iron ore to trade 39% below its 2022 peak hit in March. The pressure was also prevalent due to worries in the debt-ridden property market, as investment in Chinese real estate fell by 8% in the first three quarters of the year and property sales by floor area tanked 22%. Still, recent expansion measures by authorities support prices to be nearly 20% up in November. The national bond authority expanded a key financing program to private developers by CNY 250 billion to support the sale of bonds in the sector, after a period of defaults sharply increased the cost of credit for residence builders.

UK Budget Gap Below ForecastsUnited Kingdom Government Budget Value
Public sector net borrowing excluding public sector banks in the UK was £13.5 billion in October of 2022, £4.4 billion more than in October 2021 and the fourth highest October borrowing since monthly records began in 1993. Total expenditure rose by £6.5 billion to £91.2 billion, as it included the first indemnity payment from Treasury to the Bank of England Asset Purchase Facility Fund and the first payments under the government's energy support schemes to households and to domestic energy suppliers. However, the costs of the energy bills relief scheme for businesses was not included in the October’s estimate due to a lack of data so far. That is one of the reasons why figures came below market forecasts of a £22 billion deficit, and will probably lead to a revision next month. Meanwhile, total receipts were £77.6 billion, £0.68 billion lower than a year earlier. Tax receipts were £51.7 billion, £2.5 billion more than in October 2021.

NZ Dollar Firms Up Ahead of RBNZ DecisionNew Zealand Currency
The New Zealand dollar firmed up above $0.61 on Tuesday, holding its ground ahead of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s policy decision, where it is expected to deliver an unprecedented 75 basis point rate hike to get inflation under control. That would potentially be the biggest increase since the RBNZ introduced the OCR in 1999 and would take the policy rate to a 14-year high of 4.25%. Stubbornly high inflation and near-record low unemployment in New Zealand supported the case for a more aggressive move, in contrast to other major economies which have started to slow the pace of tightening amid growing risks of a global recession. The annual inflation rate in the country surged 7.2% in the third quarter, exceeding the central bank’s 6.4% forecast, while inflation expectations jumped to the highest since 1991.

Urea Hovers Close to 13-Month LowCommodity
Urea prices were under $600 per tonne, relatively close to the 13-month low of $562.5 touched on November 1st as the decline in European natural gas prices since the second quarter reduced costs for the energy-intensive fertilizer manufacturing process. Downward pressure on prices was also contributed to major importer India scooping up Russian fertilizers at discounted prices, freeing up supply from the Middle East to Eurasia. Previously, shortages of energy feedstock in Europe drove fertilizer manufacturers to operate well below capacity, risking shortages and sending urea prices to a record-high of $1050 per tonne in April. Supply was also jeopardized by the partial suspension of imports from major producers Russia and Belarus in retaliation to sanctions from the West.

Sugar Retreats from 7-Month HighCommodity
Sugar futures on ICE were at 20 cents per pound, easing slightly from the seven-month high of 20.3 cents touched on November 15th as the retreat in crude oil prices increased the opportunity cost of using cane feedstock to distill ethanol, driving producers to increase the crush of sugar.

Palladium Extends Losses to Below $1,900Commodity
Palladium futures fell to below $1,900 per ounce, moving closer to a 5-month low of $1,800 hit on November 3rd and in line with other commodities, as a worsening Covid-19 situation in China and more lockdowns worsened an already soft demand outlook.

Analysts who forecast supply-demand balances said they expected the palladium market to be balanced or in deficit this year and next year.

Swiss Franc Depreciates from 3-Month HighSwitzerland Currency
The Swiss franc weakened to 0.95 per USD from the three-month high of 0.94 touched on November 11th, pressured by a rebound for the greenback as recession concerns and hawkish signals from the Federal Reserve drove investors to the dollar. Still, signals of tight policy by the Swiss National Bank supported the franc to remain well above the 3-1/2-year low of 1.01 touched November 3rd.
