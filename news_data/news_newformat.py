Brazilian Stocks Extend Rally to 5th SessionBrazil Stock Market
Brazil’s benchmark Ibovespa was trading slightly above the 109,200 level on Friday, the highest since December 7th, extending gains for the fifth straight session. Consumer stocks, big banks, Petrobras and education companies were among the top performers. Investors continued to monitor economic data but remained attentive to potential domestic risks. On the data front, Brazil's 12-month inflation rate cooled down to 5.90% in the month through mid-December, from 6.17% in the previous period and well below a peak of 12.2% in May, in line with market estimates. The Ibovespa was on track to advance more than 6% this week, in the face of the positive reaction of financial agents to the reduction, to one year, of the life span of the PEC that increases government spending for 2023.

US Stocks Lower on FridayUnited States Stock Market
US stocks were slightly lower on Friday, with the Dow Jones losing nearly 70 points while the S&P 500 shed 0.1% and the Nasdaq declined nearly 0.2% as investors digest fresh economic data and try to assess the Fed's monetary policy for next year. PCE inflation which the Fed tracks closely slowed in November to the lowest since August last year and the core rate also eased but slightly less than some analysts were expecting. Meanwhile, personal spending barely rose last month and durable goods orders shrank the most in two years. Yesterday, GDP growth figures were revised higher for Q3 and the claims report continued to point to a robust labour market. Markets will be closed on Monday for the Christmas holiday.

European Natural Gas Prices Head For Sharp 33% Weekly LossCommodity
Dutch front-month gas futures fell by over 11% to €82/MWh Friday, the lowest in over six months and were on course to book a 33% weekly drop, the most since early September, dragged by forecasts for mild weather during the holiday season and ample supplies. Natural gas prices in Europe are more than 75% below record levels of nearly €350 hit in August, as record LNG imports, increased wind generation, and fuller-than-normal stockpiles ease concerns about shortages. Storage facilities in Germany were 87.3% full as of December 21st and the EU average held at 83%, above the five-year seasonal average. At the same time, supplies from Russia sent through Ukraine have been stable and weather forecasts point to normal to above-average temperatures through early January. On the political front, EU leaders reached a deal to cap natural gas prices. The cap would take effect if prices on the front-month Dutch TTF contract exceed €180/MWh for three days, and if the price of LNG is above €35/MWh.

Treasury Yields Hover at 3-Week HighUnited States Government Bond 10Y
The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note rose above the 3.7% mark, the highest in over three weeks as recent economic data releases backed the aggressively hawkish decisions and guidances by the Fed and other major central banks. The US economy expanded by 3.2% quarter-on-quarter in the three months leading to September of 2022, above earlier estimates of 2.9% and pointing to slightly better resilience since the Fed started its tightening cycle in March. Also, personal income levels remained robust in November. Still, cooler-than-expected PCE price data and spending levels for November limited further upswings for bond yields. In its last meeting, the FOMC increased projections for the federal funds rate to reach and stay at 5.1% in 2023 from prior estimates of 4.6%. Increased tightening momentum from other major central banks also pressured bond prices. Most notably, the BoJ unexpectedly widened the tolerance band on its 10-year JGB yield and the ECB signaled increased tightening.

Brent Crude Rises 2.5%, Set for 2nd Weekly GainCommodity
Brent crude futures rose 2.5% to $83 per barrel on Friday, on the prospect of lower crude supplies from Russia. Russia’s Baltic oil exports are predicted to decline by 20% month-on-month in December and the country may reduce output by 500,000 to 700,000 barrels a day in early 2023 after the European Union and G7 nations imposed sanctions and a price cap on Russian crude. The oil market is set to gain for the second straight week, on signs of tightening US crude supplies and an improving demand outlook in top crude importer China. Latest data showed that US crude inventories fell by 5.89 million barrels last week, much more than market forecasts for a 1.66 million barrel drop.

Soybeans Set for Second Weekly LossCommodity
Soybeans futures traded around $14.7 per bushel, and are on course for their consecutive week of losses as forecasts of rains in South America eased supply concerns while global recession worries offset optimism about Chinese demand. Rain showers crossed Argentina last week and are expected again in the coming days, bringing needed moisture to just over half its soy area.

Currently, the US faces competition for export business from South America, and Brazil will soon harvest its next soybean crop. On the demand side, eased Covid lockdowns in top consumer China spurred hopes of higher demand but prospects of more interest rate hikes by major central banks could trigger a global recession in 2023.

Spain Economy Barely Grows in Q3Spain GDP Growth Rate
Spain's quarterly economic growth was revised down to 0.1% in the third quarter of 2022, from a preliminary estimate of 0.2% and following an upwardly revised 2% expansion in the previous three-month period. Soaring production costs and inflation have weighed heavily on fixed investment (-0.1% vs 2.9% in Q2) and household consumption (0.1% vs 1.7%). At the same time, external demand slowed, with exports (1.5% vs 5.4% in Q2) rising much less than imports (3% vs 3% in Q2). On a yearly basis, the economy grew 4.4%, above preliminary estimates of 3.8% but down from an upwardly revised 7.6% expansion seen in the second quarter. The economic growth in Spain is expected to slow in 2023 on the back of the cost of living squeeze, but a recovering tourism industry and EU fund inflows should underpin the economy in 2024.
