US Stocks Rise Ahead of Fed MinutesUnited States Stock Market
Volatility gripped US stocks on Wednesday, with the Dow advancing more than 250 points and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 up roughly 1% each, as investors digested mixed economic data ahead of the FOMC minutes. US job openings fell slightly to 10.5 million in December but remained at considerably high levels, suggesting that wages would increase further as companies try to attract workers. However, the ISM Manufacturing PMI fell for a second consecutive month to 48.4 in December 2022, the lowest since May 2020, adding to concerns about the health of the world's largest economy while sparking speculation about a less aggressive tightening. Now, the focus turns to minutes of the latest Fed policy meeting later today, which will offer critical insight into the next move in interest rates. Rate-sensitive companies, including Apple, Facebook-parent Meta, and Tesla, were up between 2% and 4%. Meanwhile, Microsoft fell more than 4% after UBS downgraded the company's stocks to "neutral".

Russian Stocks Halt 3-Day RallyRussia Stock Market
The ruble-based MOEX Russia index erased early gains and closed 0.2% lower at 2,168 on Wednesday, halting three consecutive sessions of gains with persistent pressure from heavyweight energy producers. Oil stocks continued to decline as soaring Covid infections in China pressed demand expectations and lowered crude oil benchmark prices, with Rosneft and Surgut dropping 0.8% and 0.5%, respectively. China took the lead as the main buyer of Russian oil amid the start of the EU’s oil embargo and the G7’s price cap on oil exporting services, increasing Russia’s dependency on energy demand from China. Consequently, the spread between Urals and Brent contracts continued to widen and hover at August highs. Limiting losses, the Ministry of Finance announced last week that investors from “unfriendly” countries will only be able to sell financial instruments at half the current market price, with the government taking up to 10% of every transaction to finance its looming budget deficit.

Poland Holds Interest Rate at 6.75%Poland Interest Rate
The National Bank of Poland held its benchmark reference rate unchanged at 6.75% for the fourth consecutive time at its January 2022 meeting. The Monetary Policy Council decided to hold the interest rate steady despite soaring inflation, signaling that it will continue to prioritize a looser monetary environment as deteriorating economic conditions hamper growth. Recent data indicated that the Polish economy continued to slow in Q4 of 2022, mainly due to energy supply shocks as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The MPC assessed that the current level of borrowing costs is tight enough to prevent excess demand from pushing consumer prices upwards, while weak external conditions and global monetary tightening should drive inflation to continue slowing. The central bank also stated it will be ready to intervene in the currency market should it deem it necessary. In the meantime, the Lombard rate and the deposit rate were held steady at 7.25% and 6.25%, respectively.

Oil Plunges 4%Commodity
WTI crude futures dropped 4% to around $74 per barrel on Wednesday, not far from a one-year low of $70.3 hit on December 9th, pressured by a weakening global demand outlook amid growing fears of a Fed-induced recession in the US and persistent coronavirus-related uncertainties in top consumer China. The ISM Manufacturing PMI fell for a second consecutive month to 48.4 in December 2022, the lowest since May 2020, adding to concerns about weak demand in the world's largest economy. At the same time, a wave of infections and a rising death toll in China has hurt the near-term demand outlook in the world's second-largest economy, prompting officials to raise export quotas for refined oil products in the first batch for 2023. Meanwhile, OPEC crude production rose in December, led by a recovery in Nigerian supply, despite the cartel's agreement to cut output to support the market.

The number of job quits in the United States rose by 126,000 from a month earlier to 4.17 million in November 2022.

The so-called quits rate, which measures voluntary job leavers as a share of total employment, edged up to 2.7 percent in November from 2.6 percent in October, but was still down from a record high of 3.0 percent seen at the end of 2021.

Turkey's 10-year benchmark government bond yield traded around 8.8% in January, close to low levels not seen since April 2015, amid high inflation rate, low interest rates and the introduction of restrictive measures.

At the same time, Turkish authorities have been introducing rules that encourages residents to save in liras and banks to hold longer-term government bonds in the local currency in order to lower borrowing costs despite very high inflation.

In turn, output charges increased as well, but at the softest pace in three months.

Mortgage applications in the US declined 10.3% in the week ended December 30th 2022, the biggest decline in three months, led by a 12% plunge in the purchase index and a 4.4% drop in refinancing applications, data from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed. Mortgage rates increased, with the average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances ($647,200 or less) jumping to 6.58%, the highest since mid-November. “Mortgage rates are lower than October 2022 highs, but would have to decline substantially to generate additional refinance activity. Purchase applications have been impacted by slowing home sales in both the new and existing segments of the market. Even as home-price growth slows in many parts of the country, elevated mortgage rates continue to put a strain on affordability and are keeping prospective homebuyers out of the market”, according to Joel Kan, an MBA economist.

UK Natural Gas Hits Seven-Month LowCommodity
UK natural gas futures were trading around the 160 pence a therm mark, a level not seen since June and down roughly 80% from their March peak of 800 pence, as milder-than-normal temperatures across much of the UK and Europe limited heating demand. On top of that, households and businesses have been cutting their energy usage after a warning from National Grid in October about supply shortages in case of an extreme winter. Still, London temperatures are forecasted to fall to near average next week, which, in turn, will boost demand for heating. On the supply side, the US has agreed to increase natural gas exports to the UK as part of a joint effort to reduce costs and limit Russia's impact on western energy supplies.

German 10-Year Bond Yield Falls Below 2.3%Germany Government Bond 10Y
The yield on the German benchmark 10-year Bund extended losses to fall below 2.3% at the start of January, as investors expect a sharp slowdown in the Eurozone inflation. Data from Germany and France showed inflationary pressure in Europe's largest economies cooled more than anticipated in December, ramping up hopes of less aggressive rate hikes by the European Central Bank. Still, concerns over a global economic recession mounted amid rising borrowing costs and stubbornly high inflation. Also, expectations of increasing government funding and falling excess liquidity will likely continue to support yields amid increased public spending to fight the adverse impact of the energy crisis. In December, the European Central Bank pledged further rate hikes to fight inflation and announced it would start reducing its €5 trillion bond holdings from March.

Oil Extends LossesCommodity
WTI crude futures dropped more than 3% to below $75 per barrel on Wednesday, not far from a one-year low of $70.3 hit on December 9th, pressured by a weakening global demand outlook amid growing fears of a Fed-induced recession in the US and persistent coronavirus-related uncertainties in top consumer China. A wave of infections and a rising death toll in China has hurt the near-term demand outlook in the world’s second-largest economy, prompting officials to raise export quotas for refined oil products in the first batch for 2023. Still, the country’s continued reopening is a positive factor for the economy and, consequently, for crude demand in the long term. Meanwhile, investors remain cautious about retaliatory actions from Russia after it banned oil exports to foreign buyers that adopted the G7 price cap and the prospect of further production cuts from OPEC+.

Germany Composite PMI at 6-Month HighGermany Composite PMI
The S&P Global Germany Composite PMI was revised slightly higher to 49 in December of 2022 from a preliminary of 48.9, but still pointed to a sixth straight month of falling private sector activity. Still, it is the smallest drop in the current sequence, reflecting slower declines in both manufacturing (47.1 vs 46.2) and services (49.2 vs 46.1). New orders continued to exhibit a weaker trend than output, falling particularly sharply in manufacturing, but likewise showed a slower overall rate of contraction. This was also the case for new export orders. Led by easing manufacturing price pressures, there were further slowdowns in the rates of input cost and output charge inflation to 20- and 12-month lows respectively. Also, December saw another modest rise in private sector employment. Finally, business expectations increased.

The Australian 10-year government bond yield bottomed below the 3.9% mark, down from an over two-month peak of 4.1% hit in late December, as prospects of a significant economic downturn prompted bets that central banks will sooner or later pivot away from their aggressive tightening campaign. The Reserve Bank of Australia hiked its key rate by another 25 bps to 3.1% at its final meeting of 2022. The board also flagged more interest rate hikes as Australia's inflation is still too high.

French Services Sector Contracts Slightly Less than Early EstimateFrance Services PMI
The S&P Global France Services PMI was revised slightly up to 49.5 in December of 2022 from a flash estimate of 48.1 and above 49.3 in November. Still, the latest reading pointed to the second straight month of contraction in the country's services sector and at the steepest pace since February of 2021. Output levels were constrained by weak sales performances, as higher interest rates and inflation continued to squeeze real incomes and are eroding purchasing power. Sectors sensitive to changes in borrowing costs such as real estate were the most affected. The increase in staffing levels was slightly stronger than in the prior month, but was slower than seen on average over the two-year sequence of job growth. Meanwhile, input cost inflation remained stubbornly elevated while there were signs that companies were softening their pricing strategies as output price inflation eased to a four-month low.

The S&P Global Italy Services PMI edged higher to 49.9 in December of 2022 from 49.5 in November, beating market forecasts of 49.5. It is the highest seen since August, when growth in the services sector was last recorded.

Meanwhile, outstanding business fell as lower sales earlier in the year allowed resources to be utilised to work on existing contracts; and employment rose marginally. On the price front, costs continued to rise albeit at a slower pace, due to greater fuel, commodity, energy and material prices. Looking ahead, Italian service providers remained, on average, optimistic towards the year-ahead outlook for business activity.

Natural Gas Prices in Europe Fall Below €70Commodity
European natural gas prices continued to decline and tumbled over 5% to below €70/MWh, hitting a new low since mid-February, before the war in Ukraine started, as warmer-than-expected temperatures eased concerns over shortages and the need for gas rationing. Forecasts point to temperatures above seasonal norms for most of Europe in the next two weeks. At the same time, record LNG imports, fuller-than-normal stockpiles and increased power generation from wind in France and Germany also helped to alleviate price pressures. Gas storage across Europe is 83.5% full as of January 2nd, well above the five-year seasonal norm of 70%. Meanwhile, EU leaders reached a deal to cap natural gas prices from February 15th. Still, the outlook for 2023 remains challenging as the winter season is still ahead. Also, Europe needs to increase its LNG import capacity while a rise in gas demand from China and other Asian countries could increase competition on the LNG market

Kazakhstan Manufacturing PMI Expands for 3rd MonthKazakhstan Manufacturing PMI
The Tengri Partners Kazakhstan Manufacturing PMI fell to 50.8 in December 2022 from 51.9 in November. It was the third month of expansion, albeit the softest, as production ticked down despite improvements in new business. New orders grew slightly for the 2nd month running, but production was unable to keep pace, with some firms noting challenges on rising demand amid financial pressures. As outputs fall behind, firms sometimes turn to inventories to fulfill orders, prompting stocks of finished goods to drop for the 2nd month. Also, employment fell for the first time in three months. Meanwhile, purchasing activity rose to its fastest rate since July 2022, however firms continued to face delays due largely to disruption in logistics. On prices, input costs slowed to its 3-year low, yet the continued rises in raw materials pushed output prices to a 3-month high. Looking ahead, business confidence eased from a 20-month high, but sentiments remain above the series average.

The ANZ 50 surged 114.24 points or 1% to finish at 11,587.48 on the first trading session of 2023, recovering from losses in the prior session, buoyed by hopes for more policy support this year in China after Beijing dismantled strict COVID measures.

India Shares Fall ahead of Fed MinutesIndia Stock Market
The BSE Sensex dropped 308.0 points or 0.5% to 60,986.2 in morning deals on Wednesday after gaining in the prior session, amid the negative lead from Wall Street overnight ahead of Fed meeting minutes later today, that will provide clues about the tightening path in the US. Traders were also reluctant to enter new positions, due to uncertainty over demand recovery in China as the impact of COVID outbreaks lingered. Private survey data that showed robust growth of India's services sector in December was unable to lift sentiment, as market participants cautiously awaited a string of US economic data, including nonfarm payrolls figures on Friday. Almost all of the 15 sectors traded in the red, dragged down by metals, PSU Bank, realty, and auto. Energy stocks also sank after New Delhi raised taxes on fuel exports and domestic crude after an uptick in oil prices. Other notable losses were Hindalco (-3.8%), Vedanta (-3.5%), JSW Steel (-3.4%), Bank Baroda (-2.5%), and Tata Motors (-1.8%).

Oil Holds Decline on Demand ConcernsCommodity
