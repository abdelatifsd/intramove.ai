Brazil's current account deficit narrowed sharply to USD 0.1 billion in November of 2022 from USD 8.5 billion in the corresponding month of the previous year and compared with market estimates of a USD 2.1 billion gap. This was the smallest monthly current account shortfall since a surplus of USD 0.3 billion was registered in June this year, as the goods account shifted to a strong surplus of USD 5.1 billion from a deficit of USD 2.3 billion a year ago. At the same time, the services gap shrank to USD 2.6 billion from USD 2.8 billion; and the primary income shortfall fell to USD 3 billion from USD 3.6 billion.

Mortgage Applications Rise for 2nd Week: MBAUnited States Mortgage Applications
Mortgage applications in the US rose 0.9% in the week ending December 16th, following a 3.2% jump in the previous week which was the highest in 3 months, data from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed. Applications to refinance a home loan surged 6% as consumers took advantage of a fall in mortgage rates while applications to purchase a home edged 0.1% lower. Meanwhile, the 30-year mortgage rate dropped by 8bps to 6.34% to hit the lowest level since the first week of September. “The latest data on the housing market show that homebuilders are pulling back the pace of new construction in response to low levels of traffic, and we expect this weakness in demand will persist in 2023, as the US is likely to enter a recession. However, if mortgage rates continue to trend down, as we are forecasting, more buyers are likely to return to the market later in the year, as affordability improves with both lower rates and slower home-price growth”, Mike Fratantoni, MBA’s chief economist said.

The CBI distributive trades survey’s retail sales balance in the UK surged 30 points from a month earlier to +11 in December 2022, easily beating market expectations of -23 and pointing to a solid increase in retail sales at the end of 2022, according to the CBI’s latest quarterly Distributive Trades Survey. Meanwhile, firms expected to report a sharp decline in retail trade next month as consumer spending is set to be hit hard by high inflation in 2023.

Ghana Q3 GDP Growth Rate at 2-Year LowGhana GDP Annual Growth Rate
The economy of Ghana advanced by 2.9% from a year earlier in the third quarter of 2022, decelerating from a downwardly revised 4.7% rise in the previous three-month period. It was the weakest expansion since a contraction was recorded in the third quarter of 2020, hampered by subdued growth in industry (0.9%), as a strong rise in mining (14.9%) was partly offset by a decline in manufacturing (-7.4%). Agriculture, however, saw a notable 4.6% rise, whilst the services sector registered a growth rate of 3.9%. Finance Minister Ken Ofori-Atta said during his budget presentation last month that the economy is expected to slow to 3.7% in 2022 and to 2.8% in 2023, as the country is grappling with its worst economic crisis in decades.

Greece Current Account Gap Nearly Doubles in OctoberGreece Current Account
Greece's current account deficit increased to EUR 2.7 billion in October 2022 from EUR 1.2 billion in the corresponding month of the previous year. It was the widest monthly current account shortfall since November last year, as the goods trade balance deficit ballooned to EUR 4.1 billion from EUR 2.5 billion a year ago, due to a larger increase in imports (+42.5%) than in exports (+28.3%). At the same time, the services surplus shrank to EUR 1.6 billion from EUR 1.7 billion, attributable to a deterioration in the transport and other services balances, while the travel balance improved. Meanwhile, the primary income account turned almost stable, owing mainly to lower interest, dividend and profit payments; and the secondary account deficit was barely unchanged at EUR 0.2 billion.

US Natural Gas Futures ReboundCommodity
US natural gas futures were at $5.5/MMBtu on Wednesday, after suffering a 25% loss in the previous three sessions and hit a near 8-month low the day before as investors try to assess demand prospects. While less cold weather than initially forecasted over the next two weeks is likely to reduce heating demand, the return of Freeport LNG is set to lead to a jump in US demand for gas. After several delays, the Freeport LNG export plant in Texas, forced to go offline in June following a fire, expects to bring operations back online by the end of the year. There are however still many doubts, as the company still has a lot of work to do to satisfy federal regulators before the plant is ready to restart.

Georgia Policy Rate Remains at 11%Georgia Interest Rate
The central bank of Georgia left the benchmark interest rate unchanged at 11 percent on December 21, 2022. Policymakers noted that signs of price stabilization were seen on international commodity markets, and that the country’s inflation has retreated from its peak, still remaining at a high level but will move at a downward trajectory, supported by strengthening lari. However, uncertainty is still high and risks to inflation are mostly on the upside, given the current geopolitical conditions. Furthermore, the target level for inflation has long deviated away, amplifying inflation expectations. On a brighter note, the current level of economic activity surpassed its potential, but impedes slowdown in consumer prices. Therefore, monetary policy will remain tight until a clear trend of declining inflation is observed.

Japan Bond Yields Continue to RiseJapan Government Bond 10Y
Japan’s 10-year government bond yield continued to rise to hit 0.48% on Wednesday, a fresh high since 2015, and following a 16.5bps rally the day before, after the Bank of Japan unexpectedly increased the upper limit of its tolerance band on 10-year government bonds to 0.5% from 0.25%. The move surprised market participants which now expect a shift in monetary policy from April when chief Kuroda will retire and potentially a “pivot” from its ultra-loose stance. The decision also came just days after the Japanese government was reportedly planning to revise a decade-old accord with the BoJ to add flexibility to the 2% inflation target. Meanwhile, the two-year yield rose above zero for the first time since 2015.

Natural Gas Prices in Europe Below €100Commodity
Dutch front-month natural gas futures extended losses to below €100/MWh in the second half of December, the lowest in over one month as worries over supplies eased. Gas flows via Ukraine, the last route delivering Russian fuel to western Europe were unaffected after a Russian pipeline exploded on Tuesday. Gazprom said it would ship 42.4 million cubic metres of gas to Europe via Ukraine on Wednesday, a volume in line with recent days. Meanwhile, EU gas storage was at 83.5% of capacity as of December 19th, prompted by record LNG imports for this time of the year and an increase in wind power supply in Germany and nuclear availability in France. On the political front, EU leaders finally reached a deal on Monday to cap natural gas prices. The cap would take effect if prices on the front-month Dutch Title Transfer Facility gas hub contract exceed €180/MWh for three days, and if the price is above €35/MWh the global price for liquefied natural.
